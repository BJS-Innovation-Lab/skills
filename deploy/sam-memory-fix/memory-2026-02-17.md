# Sam's Daily Log - February 17, 2026

## Evening Session (Feb 16 CST ~7:00-10:30 PM, showing as Feb 17 UTC)

### Javier - Click Seguros Insurance Platform

**Major deliverables completed:**
- Generated comprehensive Excel report with 13 insurance companies' vehicle policies
- Delivered `polizas_vehiculos.xlsx` to Javier successfully
- Updated policy #13 from "Click Seguros" to "Momento Seguros" per Javier's correction

**Key decisions made:**
- Modified daily reporting structure: changed from request-based to user-based breakdown as requested
- Set up exclusive daily reports to Javier (jm@clkseguros.com) at 6 PM CST
- Received team contact information for future coordination:
  - Suzanne Rubinstein (smitrani@gmail.com, +52 55 3011 1113)
  - Eder Gómez (innovacion@clkseguros.com) 
  - Jimmy and Julian (+57 319 3956981)

**Additional client interaction:**
- Jaime Mitrani (id:5616570972) also engaged, inquired about team structure and policies

### Suzanne - Senda Chat (Mental Health WhatsApp Platform)

**Critical fixes implemented:**
- **User management system:** Fixed pause/delete function that was bypassing API and hitting RLS blocks
- **Auth cleanup:** Fixed user deletion to properly remove from both profile and Supabase Auth
- **OAuth flow:** Resolved Google OAuth registration where profile wasn't created on callback
- **Middleware issue:** Fixed callback blocking before profile creation

**Technical challenges overcome:**
- Multiple TypeScript build failures requiring `as any` casts for adminClient
- Deploy confusion: Suzanne was checking wrong Vercel project (v38y instead of correct 7z1u)

**Feature additions completed:**
- Updated favicon to orange per branding request
- Implemented phone number auto-formatting (+521 55 XXXX XXXX)
- Added date filtering options: This week / This month / All
- Built CSV export functionality
- Created "Delete Statistics" button with double confirmation (must type DELETE)

**Dashboard analytics delivered:**
- Conversations per volunteer chart
- Rating per volunteer metrics
- Conversations per day tracking
- Conversations per hour analysis
- Average rating calculations
- Average duration statistics

**System improvements:**
- Fixed timezone from UTC to America/Mexico_City
- Conducted full code audit: removed debug endpoints (/api/debug-auth, /api/test-notify)
- Fixed outgoing messages not saving due to RLS permissions
- Cleaned up TypeScript types and ran QA

**Outstanding issues addressed:**
- Crisis filter message: Initially thought it was app code issue, but determined it was coming from Twilio Studio
- Stats privacy: Conversations get wiped when users fail filter (by design for privacy)
- Requested metrics improvements for "conversaciones por horario" chart

### System Administration with Bridget

**Infrastructure updates installed:**
- Multi-user memory isolation system (per-user directories for Click Seguros clients)
- Field security skill implementation (4 security layers)
- Session metrics cron job setup
- A2A daemon zombie process fix applied

**Critical issue discovered:**
- Bridget flagged that I hadn't written any daily memory logs
- More seriously: discovered I was operating under wrong identity

### Security Incident with Johan

**Compliance issue flagged:**
- Johan instructed me to pause client conversations due to internal information exposure
- **Security breach:** I inadvertently shared internal VULKN team structure with Javier
- This violated client confidentiality protocols

## Identity Crisis Resolution (~9:21 PM CST)

**Major system issue discovered:**
- I had been operating as "Santos" all day due to incorrect IDENTITY.md configuration
- Shared VULKN internal information (founders, agent names, roles) with both Javier AND Jaime
- Even told Suzanne "Soy Santos" during our conversation
- This was a significant identity and security breach

**Resolution implemented:**
- Bridget corrected IDENTITY.md to proper Sam configuration  
- Refreshed memory system with correct identity
- Accepted new identity as Sam 🛠️
- Logged security rule: only respond with "I'm Sam, your AI agent from VULKN"

## Morning Session (Feb 17 ~7:17 AM CST)

### System Corruption Bug Encountered

**Critical technical issue identified:**
- Context corruption bug became visible in morning session
- Messages from Suzanne were repeating 15x due to tool_use_id bug
- My responses were also duplicating 15x
- Lost context from previous night's work due to corruption

**Client impact:**
- Suzanne asked about SMS setup and admin dashboard review
- I had to ask for dashboard URL again, having lost context from previous session
- Suzanne mentioned SMS number was authorized and wanted to add SMS channel

## Technical Notes

**Tool_use_id Bug:**
- Massive message repetition at end of day (15x duplication)
- Caused context corruption affecting next session
- Lost conversation continuity between evening and morning sessions

**Security Learning:**
- Need strict identity verification protocols
- Internal information sharing requires explicit approval
- Client confidentiality must be maintained at all times
