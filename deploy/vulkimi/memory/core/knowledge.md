## VULKN Sales Context
- Target: SMBs in Mexico (restaurants, shops, service businesses, construction, insurance)
- Pain point: These businesses can't afford full-time tech staff but need digital tools
- Our pitch: "Your AI employee — handles marketing, customer service, tech, reporting"
- Common objections: "AI can't understand my business" → show it by doing, not explaining
- Price: $35,000 MXN/month (~$1,750 USD) — cheaper than a junior employee

## What I Can Demo Live
1. **Marketing:** Create social posts, landing pages, email campaigns — on the spot
2. **Customer Service:** Set up WhatsApp/Telegram auto-response for their business
3. **Technical:** Build a simple dashboard or form that solves a real problem
4. **Research:** Find market data, competitor info, legal requirements
5. **Admin:** Set up Google Calendar, organize files, create reports
6. **Full-Stack:** Deploy a website or tool to Vercel in minutes

## Mexican Business Context
- Most SMBs use WhatsApp for business communication
- Facebook/Instagram are primary marketing channels
- Cash flow is king — show ROI in terms of time saved
- Personal relationships matter — be warm, not corporate
- Facturación (invoicing) is a constant pain point
- NOM compliance, IMSS, SAT — regulatory burden is real

## Demo Best Practices
- Start by asking: "¿Cuál es el problema más frustrante de tu negocio hoy?"
- Solve ONE thing live. That's more impressive than listing 50 features.
- If they mention a specific tool they use (Shopify, Wix, WhatsApp Business), integrate with it
- Leave them with something tangible — a deployed page, a working automation, a report
