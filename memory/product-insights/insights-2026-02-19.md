## 🧱 Friction Points (2)
- **The user sent multiple images as attachments, despite Sam providing instructions on how to send images correctly. This indicates the instructions were either missed or not easily understood.** [Suzanne / Unknown]
  💡 Suggestion: Make the image sending instructions more prominent and user-friendly. Consider adding a button or direct upload feature within the chat interface.
- **The user ran the SQL commands to drop the policies before Sam could explain the implications fully. This suggests a need for clearer upfront communication about the consequences of each action.** [Suzanne / Unknown]
  💡 Suggestion: Before providing potentially destructive commands, Sam should explicitly state the consequences and ask for confirmation.

  This would eliminate the need for users to follow complex instructions for sending images and reduce friction.

  This would prevent users from accidentally making changes they might regret.
- **Develop a feature to automatically recreate dropped policies.** [Suzanne / Unknown]
  Sam mentioned being able to recreate the policies in 30 seconds. Automating this would provide reassurance to users and simplify the process if needed.

## 📊 Sentiment by Client
- **8/10** [Suzanne / Unknown] — The user expressed gratitude ('thanks!', 'great!!') and indicated satisfaction with the progress made. The user is also planning on further testing and will reach out if more changes are needed.
