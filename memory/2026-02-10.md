## VULKN Pitch Deck Project

### Context
- **VULKN**: New BJS Labs company for agentic AI systems targeting SMBs
- **Target market**: Mexico first (construction company as first client), then US
- **Core messaging**: "We build. You lead." — Human-first, NOT about replacing workers
- **Three Pillars**: Vitality (happiness) → Longevity (sustainability) → Resources (profit)

### Design Iterations Today

**V1 (rejected)**: Dark/black tech aesthetic
- Bridget criticized as "all black" and looking like Johan's branding
- Johan's existing deck: https://vulkn-pitch-deck.vercel.app/ (wrong messaging - replacement-focused)

**V2 (better, but pivoted)**: Warm earthy design
- Cream backgrounds, terracotta/amber accents
- Playfair Display serif font
- Inspired by Hermosillo (Mexican construction company)
- Feedback: "Much better" but wanted different direction

**V3 (current)**: Modern clean tech
- White backgrounds, indigo/purple accents
- Space Grotesk font
- Inspired by Linear, Notion, modern B2B SaaS
- Card-based layouts, fixed nav, trust logos section
- Path: `~/.openclaw/workspace/agentic-smb/pitch-deck/index-v3.html`

### Key Feedback from Bridget
- Don't focus too much on "not replacing anyone" in messaging
- Johan has brown hair (for avatar)
- Wanted more web research for inspiration
- Wants tech-oriented but NOT like Johan's original dark design

### Files Created
- `agentic-smb/pitch-deck/index.html` - V2 warm design
- `agentic-smb/pitch-deck/index-v3.html` - V3 modern tech design

### Pending
- Awaiting feedback on V3 design
- Vercel deployment still blocked (no auth token found)
