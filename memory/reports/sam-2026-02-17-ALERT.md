# ⚠️ DATA QUALITY ALERT: sam
**Date:** 2026-02-17

## Problem
❌ **No data at all** in Supabase for sam on 2026-02-17.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total docs synced today | 0 |
| Daily file lines | 0 |
| Daily file chars | 0 |
| Client interaction notes | 0 |

## What This Means
The agent  **did not write meaningful daily notes**.
If the agent was active with clients today, those interactions are lost — not logged to memory, not available for reports.

## Action Required
1. Check if sam had client sessions today (Telegram activity)
2. If yes → agent is not writing to daily memory files during work
3. Send directive to write daily notes and run Memory API after compaction
