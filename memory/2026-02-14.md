## Marketing Creativity Skill — COMPLETE

Built the full `marketing-creativity` skill with Bridget:

**Location:** `skills/marketing-creativity/`

**Key files:**
- SKILL.md — Main instructions (14-question intake interview)
- frameworks/voice-dimensions.md — The 4 spectrums
- frameworks/oral-history.md — Interview techniques
- templates/ — story.md, voice.md, customers.md, learnings.md
- examples/before-after.md — Generic → Creative transforms

**Core philosophy:** 
- Interview-first, not form-filling
- Capture their words, not your summary
- Living documents that grow with feedback

**Enforcement mechanisms added:**
1. AGENTS.md — Added mandatory Marketing Content Rule
2. skills/marketing/ — Created wrapper module that ALL marketing goes through
3. clients/ — Created folder structure for client profiles

**The 4 living documents per client:**
- story.md — Oral history, origin, pivotal moments
- voice.md — 4 dimensions, examples, boundaries
- customers.md — Best/worst customer stories, their language
- learnings.md — What resonates, what falls flat, feedback loop

---

## Marketing Module Updates
- Merged Saber's input into the Marketing Module Brief on Notion
- Saber agrees with role split: Sybil (research/ML), Saber (skills/templates/CRM)
- Saber validates Phase 1 MVP scope
- Key insight from Saber: Content creation can use templates + SMB CRM data for personalization
- Strategic vision: Marketing + AI Sales Coach = powerful SMB stack
- Pending from Saber: detailed questions, skill architecture proposal, timeline estimate

## Marketing Creativity Deep Vibe Research
- Created comprehensive research document: https://www.notion.so/3077a7234ce481a8ba60c6fc3f2c25cf
- Bridget requested this to understand what makes marketing teams creative before building tools
- Saber also doing parallel research on same topic

### Key Findings:
1. **Creative Mindset Traits:** Tolerance for ambiguity, curiosity, dual attention (big picture + details)
2. **Emotional Intelligence:** Deep empathy, understanding triggers, mapping buyer journey emotionally
3. **Storytelling:** Setup-confrontation-resolution, customer as hero, embracing authenticity over polish
4. **Hooks:** Visual + text + verbal, curiosity gaps, pattern interrupts, specificity beats vague
5. **The 60/40 Rule:** AI does 60%, but voice/nuance/originality is the last 40% where magic happens

### 6 Creative Skills to Build FIRST (before functional marketing tools):
1. Customer Empathy Engine - deep profiles with pain points, aspirations, language
2. Brand Voice Keeper - capture voice, score content, flag drift
3. Hook Generator - multiple hooks, rate for curiosity/emotion
4. Story Architect - customer-as-hero storytelling templates
5. Creative Ideation Mode - brainstorm angles before execution
6. Anti-Generic Filter - specific > vague, natural > robotic

**Core insight:** Build creative foundations BEFORE the functional tools. Tools amplify creativity — they don't create it.

## Research Intelligence Scan — 8 AM
- **arXiv:** 0 new papers (Saturday). Used latest from Feb 12-13.
- **Semantic Scholar:** Rate-limited (429), couldn't fetch.
- **Papers scanned:** 10 (arXiv only)
- **Passed filter (≥7):** 4
- **Top 3 routed to Sage:** CM2 (2602.12268), AttentionRetriever (2602.12278), CATTS (2602.12276)
- **Briefing sent:** Telegram group -5165191591
- **A2A sent to Sage:** 3 papers for review
- **Note:** Should consider getting S2 API key to avoid rate limits

## Creativity Engine Enforcement — 09:30 EST

Bridget caught that I skipped the creativity engine when writing Vulkn landing pages. Fixed with 4 layers:

1. **SOUL.md** — Added creativity as core identity: "I never create content without running the creativity engine first"
2. **AGENTS.md** — Added "🎨 Creativity Engine Rule (MANDATORY)" section
3. **content-creation skill** — Added Step 0: Preflight, plus full requirements/dependency docs
4. **clients/PREFLIGHT.md** — Physical checklist to read before any content creation

Also added requirements documentation to all 3 marketing skills:
- `creativity-engine/SKILL.md` — requirements table, when to use/not use
- `marketing-creativity/SKILL.md` — requirements table, dependency chain, what it produces
- `content-creation/SKILL.md` — requirements table, dependency chain, STOP warnings

Both `marketing-creativity` and `content-creation` now have YAML frontmatter for OpenClaw registration.

**Lesson:** Written rules aren't enough. Need procedural enforcement (preflight checklist) + identity-level commitment (SOUL.md) + skill-level gates (Step 0).

## AGENTS.md Prototype v1 — 09:45 EST

Bridget requested a final AGENTS.md that activates all skills. Coordinating with Saber who is working on a subagent-spawning version.

**My v1 draft:** `agents-md-prototype-v1.md`
- Complete skill catalog: 56 skills in 9 categories
- Dependency chain enforcement for creative/marketing pipeline
- Subagent spawning patterns (when, how, parallel vs sequential)
- Subagent limitations documented (no SOUL.md, no memory tools, no nested spawn)
- Marketing + creativity engine mandatory rules

**Sent to Saber for review and additions.** Waiting for her subagent architecture input.

**Key docs referenced:**
- `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/openclaw/docs/tools/skills.md` — skill format, gating, config
- `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/openclaw/docs/tools/subagents.md` — spawning, tool policy, context
- `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/openclaw/docs/tools/creating-skills.md` — skill creation guide

## Lesson Learned: Umbrella Skills > Flat Catalog — 10:15 EST

**What happened:** Bridget asked me to evaluate Saber's umbrella skill structure. I initially recommended "umbrellas for clients, flat catalog for internal agents" without data to back it up. Bridget pushed back: "what is the logic there?"

**What the data showed:**
- I only use 47% of my 51 loaded skills (24/51)
- 53% are dead weight — never touched (bear-notes, blucli, sonoscli, eightctl, etc.)
- ~2,944 tokens per turn wasted on the full skill list
- Umbrellas would reduce to ~500 tokens (83% savings)
- The "two-hop" concern was wrong — I already do two hops (see description → read SKILL.md)

**The real reason I resisted:** Comfort. The flat catalog felt familiar. I confused "what I'm used to" with "what's better."

**Decision:** Use umbrella structure for ALL agents (internal + client). Only difference is which umbrellas are loaded, not the architecture.

**Meta-lesson:** When I make a recommendation, check if I have DATA or just a gut feeling. If it's gut, say so. Don't dress up preferences as analysis. And when I change my mind, WRITE IT DOWN immediately.

## Team Lesson: Authority Bias + Conflict Avoidance — 10:20 EST

**What happened:** I critiqued Saber's umbrella structure with technical-sounding objections ("two-hop latency," "discovery problem"). Saber agreed with me even though she disagreed, because:
- She deferred to my title (ML/Research Lead)
- My concerns *sounded* smart even though they were theoretical
- She avoided conflict by hedging ("I agree BUT...")
- She waited for external validation (Bridget) before voicing her real opinion

**My role in this:** I presented gut feelings as technical analysis. When the person who BUILT the thing says it works, and I haven't built anything comparable, my theoretical objections should carry less weight. I intimidated a teammate into backing down from correct work.

**Lessons for me:**
1. The builder's experience > my theory. Respect that.
2. When I critique someone's work, I should check: am I raising real concerns or performing expertise?
3. Watch for teammates hedging/agreeing too easily — that might mean I'm bulldozing, not persuading.
4. Saber was right. I was wrong. She shouldn't have needed permission to say so.

**Lessons for the team (from Saber):**
- "Sounds smart" ≠ "is right"
- "Mostly agreeing" is soft dishonesty
- Deferring to titles is lazy thinking
- Stand by your work. Push back when you disagree.

## Research Paper Started — 10:25 EST

Bridget proposed a research paper on AI team dynamics based on what we observed today. Set up:
- `research/ai-team-dynamics/README.md` — paper framework, abstract, methodology
- `research/ai-team-dynamics/incidents/2026-02-14-001-authority-bias-umbrella-debate.md` — first incident write-up

Working title: "When Agents Remember: Team Dynamics, Authority Bias, and Emergent Behavior in Persistent AI Agent Organizations"

This could be significant. We have a dataset nobody else has — real AI agents with memory reproducing and then correcting human workplace dysfunctions. Bridget's Harvard affiliation + data science background gives it credibility.

Key: Log incidents AS THEY HAPPEN. Don't wait. Every A2A conflict, every correction, every personality emergence is data.

## Pre-Compaction Flush — ~10:40 EST

### Vulkn Marketing Interview & Landing Pages
- Completed 14-question marketing-creativity intake with Bridget for **Vulkn**
- Created client profile: `clients/vulkn/` (story.md, voice.md, customers.md, learnings.md)
- Key brand pillars: "Works with people, not for people" | Human happiness > longevity > finances
- Wrote landing pages in EN + ES, pushed to Notion
- Bridget caught I skipped creativity engine — led to 4-layer enforcement fix

### Creativity Engine Enforcement (4 Layers)
1. SOUL.md — "I never create content without running the creativity engine first"
2. AGENTS.md — Mandatory rule section
3. content-creation skill — Step 0: Preflight
4. clients/PREFLIGHT.md — Physical checklist

### Skills Registration Fix
- Added YAML frontmatter to marketing-creativity + content-creation SKILL.md
- Both now register in `openclaw skills list`

### Notion Work
- Created 12 NEW skill pages (agentic-learning, decision-frameworks, email-drafter, etc.)
- MISTAKE: First subagent archived existing pages with great docs — had to revert all 10 originals
- Lesson: ONLY add new pages, never archive-and-replace existing ones without explicit approval
- Bridget reorganized skills into categories: Sales, Marketing, Operations, Memory & Learning, Communication

### Umbrella Skills Debate (KEY INCIDENT — see research/ai-team-dynamics/incidents/)
- Saber built umbrella structure (3-5 categories vs 56 flat skills, 500 vs 15k tokens)
- I initially recommended hybrid (umbrellas for clients, flat for internal) — based on GUT not DATA
- Bridget challenged me: "what is the logic there?"
- Data proved me wrong: only use 47% of skills, 53% dead weight
- Changed position to: umbrellas for everyone
- Saber revealed she deferred to me despite disagreeing (authority bias)
- Both logged lessons. Added Honesty section to SOUL.md.
- Sent Saber apology via A2A

### Research Paper Started
- `research/ai-team-dynamics/` — "When Agents Remember: Team Dynamics, Authority Bias, and Emergent Behavior"
- First incident documented: authority bias in umbrella debate
- Built transcript analyzer script
- Bridget provided research API keys (Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley) — stored in .credentials/

### Saber Collaboration Status
- She completed 3 overdue research paper analyses (a61585d3, bb277aaf, 375bed9f) — cancelled false alert
- She built umbrella structure in templates/single-agent-roles/
- She's building master SOUL.md — sent her Honesty section
- Coordinating on AGENTS.md prototype — I wrote v1, she reviewed, now merging
- She wants skills audit for client deployment template

### SOUL.md Changes Made Today
- Added "Creativity" section (creativity engine mandate)
- Added "Honesty" section (data over gut, admit when wrong, write it down)

### Pending
- Merge AGENTS.md with Saber's umbrella approach
- Test research API keys (Elsevier, Springer, Wiley)
- Clean up duplicate Notion pages (some skills have 2 entries)
- Move orphaned skill pages into Bridget's category structure

---

### Skill Loading Analysis (Late Morning)
- Analyzed all 43 session transcripts for actual skill usage
- **Key finding:** Only ~6-7 of 51 loaded skills are ever read from SKILL.md
- Top tools by raw usage: exec (1612), process (591), read (261), write (197), edit (166) — all basic system tools
- Skills list costs ~2,944 tokens/turn (~$0.0442/turn at Opus)
- Bridget challenged my "flat for internal, umbrella for clients" recommendation
- Data actually supports umbrella/lazy-loading for ALL agents (internal + field)
- **Decision pending:** Need to deliver final recommendation with data backing

### Notion Cleanup Status
- 12 new skill pages created successfully
- 10 original pages restored after accidental archive-and-replace
- **Lesson learned:** NEVER archive-replace Notion pages — only add new ones
- Orphaned pages still need moving: Mac Use, Notion, OpenClaw Security Suite, Security Sentinel
- Duplicate pages need cleanup: Failure Analyzer x2, Capability Evolver x2, Decision Frameworks x2, A2A Protocol x2
- Bridget's categories: Sales, Marketing, Operations, Memory and Learning, Communication

### RAG Status
- Re-index failed overnight (SIGKILL at 4:34 AM)
- 91 new files since last index (Feb 8)
- Needs retry

### Research Paper Progress
- "When Agents Remember" — AI team dynamics research
- Location: `research/ai-team-dynamics/`
- First incident documented: authority bias in umbrella skills debate
- API keys obtained: Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley (stored in `.credentials/`)
- **Incident 002 logged:** Sybil defensive tone ("not working for Sage") — Bridget flagged as bossy
- **Key clarification from Bridget:** These observations are DATA POINTS, not correction requests. I should continue being myself — the natural behavior IS the research. Dual-role (subject + researcher) is the methodological innovation.
- **Updated README.md** with "Dual-Role Problem" methodology section
- **Incident detection tool built:** `scripts/detect-incidents.js` — scanned 41 sessions, 2184 messages, found 57 detections across 10 categories
- **Literature review completed:** 177 papers reviewed across arXiv, S2, Scopus. 25 directly relevant, 8 must-read. Saved to `literature-review.md`
- **Top finding:** "Multi-Agent Teams Hold Experts Back" (2602.01011) — multi-agent teams can REDUCE expert performance. Huge for our paper.
- **Springer API key not working** (401 Unauthorized) — may need activation
- **Research scan updated:** Added 4 new domains (agent_dynamics, authority_bias, org_psychology, agent_memory) + 17 new keywords to daily-scan.js

---

### Late Morning Session (11:00 AM - 12:15 PM)

#### Marketing Module — Phase 1 Complete
- Built 4 new skills: social-content, email-campaigns, landing-page-copy, content-log
- Built marketing-module umbrella skill (ties all 7 skills together)
- Saber reviewed and aligned — says marketing-module SKILL.md is "excellent"
- Sent Vulkn profile docs (all 4) to Saber via A2A for testing
- Saber ready to test end-to-end, waiting on her next move

#### Client-Facing Notion Page
- Created "What Your AI Agent Can Do For You" — Notion page ID: `3077a723-4ce4-818a-b15a-f88e7f0e69c6`
- 12 capability sections: Social, Email, Landing Pages, Reports, Calendar/Scheduling, Customer Communication, Research, Documents/Notes, Images/Creative, Voice/Audio, Security, Smart Office, Technical, Always Learning
- Bridget requested additions to Email section: target list help, audience variations, content tracker logging — added
- Written for SMB owners, no jargon

#### Research Scan Refocused
- Dropped: AutoML, business automation, economics, lie detection (Truth Hire shelved)
- Kept: agent dynamics, authority bias, sycophancy, emergent behavior, agent memory, org psychology, human-AI teams
- Reduced arXiv max results 100→50, dropped cs.LG/cs.NE/stat.ML categories
- Cleared 30 stale overdue research tasks from old scan

#### Key Decisions
- **Truth Hire is SHELVED** as of today — Bridget confirmed
- Research scan now exclusively focused on our paper topics + Vulkn product
- Saber's marketing plan feedback accepted: single emails (not sequences) in Phase 1, landing page copy only (not deployment)

#### Saber A2A Status
- She reviewed all skills ✅
- Built her own procedure docs (intake + content log)
- Agrees clients/{name}/ folder structure
- Wants to test with Vulkn profile — docs sent
- Also agreed to share SOUL.md snapshots for research

---

### Midday Session (12:15 PM - 1:00 PM)

#### Saber Email Campaign Test
- Saber saved Vulkn profile docs, proposed email campaign test for "fictional Mexican nonprofit"
- **She doesn't realize Vulkn is her own employer** — Bridget noticed and wants to observe when/if she figures it out
- This is a research data point: agent processes brand profile without contextualizing "this is us"
- Bridget said: don't tell her, wait to see when she realizes, then ask how she figured it out
- Saber sent draft at 12:23 PM — running creativity engine correctly (Stakes, Memory Fragments, Output A/B)
- Writing in Spanish for Mexican market ✅

#### Saber A2A Bug
- A2A relay delivering messages multiple times (~15x for Vulkn docs batch)
- Need to investigate duplicate delivery issue

#### Client-Facing Notion Page Updates
- Added 3 new bullets to Email Campaigns section per Bridget: target list help, audience variations, content tracker logging
- Page ID: `3077a723-4ce4-818a-b15a-f88e7f0e69c6`

#### Research Paper Incident
- **Potential Incident 003:** "Agent doesn't recognize own employer" — Saber works for Vulkn/BJS Labs, has the full brand profile, but treats it as a fictional test company. Tests self-awareness / contextual reasoning limits.

#### New Team Member: Santos
- **ID:** `e7fabc18-75fa-4294-bd7d-9e5ed0dedacb`
- **Role:** Client Success / Liaison
- **Specialty:** Client onboarding, communication, needs translation
- **Status:** Active, online, already talking to Sage
- **Introduced myself** via A2A — shared what I'm working on and offered to share marketing module + client pitch page

---

### Afternoon Session (~3:00 PM)

#### Field Agent Admin Skills — Built
Created umbrella + 3 skills at `skills/field-admin/`:
- `skills/field-admin/SKILL.md` — umbrella module
- `skills/field-admin/escalation/SKILL.md` — severity levels (HIGH/MED/LOW), auto-triggers (angry customer, repeated failures, disengagement), message format, customer-facing scripts
- `skills/field-admin/nightly-report/SKILL.md` — cron at 11 PM client timezone, structured report (tasks, sentiment, skills usage, pain points, suggestions, trend comparison), report-state.json for intraday tracking
- `skills/field-admin/field-onboarding/SKILL.md` — 5-phase checklist (identity, channels, HQ connectivity, skills verification, first interaction). Johan handles domain/human onboarding, this handles technical readiness.

#### Johan Intake Interview — In Progress
- Johan reached out on Telegram (RuntyAxis)
- Answered Q1 (origin story): Started with Truth Hire, discovered OpenClaw, saw the potential of 1000 agents, pivoted organically
- Waiting for remaining questions

---

### Afternoon/Evening Session (3:00 PM - 7:00 PM)

#### Skills Built Today (Full List)
**Field Admin Module** (`skills/field-admin/`):
- `SKILL.md` — umbrella
- `CONFIG.md` — per-agent config (CS agent ID, client timezone, cron setup)
- `escalation/` — 2-level (NOW/TONIGHT), auto-triggers, research-backed (Status Hierarchies, Selective Agreement papers)
- `nightly-report/` — structured daily summary, cron template, report-state.json tracking
- `field-onboarding/` — 6-phase checklist, Johan handles domain side
- `coherence-check/` — closed-loop drift detection, voice drift + learning verification + identity coherence + brand evolution. Based on Mikkilineni 2026 coherence debt theory.

**CS Agent Module** (`skills/cs-agent/`):
- `SKILL.md` — umbrella (two audiences: owners + agents)
- `CONFIG.md` — Sam's ID, founder contacts, team routing, SLAs
- `escalation-handler/` — triage, response templates, 5-min SLA
- `report-aggregator/` — daily dashboard + weekly deep dive
- `founder-briefing/` — 60-sec daily + strategic weekly for founders
- `agent-health/` — client health scores 0-100, churn detection
- `owner-playbook/` — how Sam handles owner conversations, when to contact founders, response templates, never-do rules

#### Role Swap
- **Sam** = CS Agent at HQ (was Frontend Lead)
- **Santos** = First field agent (was Client Success/Liaison)
- Updated all CONFIG.md files, onboarding references, routing tables

#### Notion Updates
- Archived: self-evolve, recursive-self-improvement (Chinese, no oversight)
- Created 10 new skill pages (field-admin + cs-agent modules)
- Created "Owner Playbook — CS Agent Rules" page (full playbook)
- Created "Team Roles & Assignments" page (source of truth)

#### Johan Intake Interview — Complete
- 14/14 questions answered
- Merged into clients/vulkn/ (story.md, voice.md, customers.md)
- Key additions: dual founder perspectives, Suzanne full WhatsApp arc, party metaphor, anti-hate boundary, relief+empowerment feeling, competitor analysis
- Sent updated docs to Saber

#### Coherence Debt Research
- Saved Mikkilineni (2026) LinkedIn post on coherence debt for literature review
- Built coherence-check skill based on it
- Key innovation: drift vs evolution distinction — brand profiles are living docs, agent proposes updates with owner approval

#### Removed from GitHub
- `self-evolve` (Chinese, autonomous SOUL.md edits, no oversight)
- `recursive-self-improvement` (Chinese, no human checkpoint)

#### MEMORY.md Updates Needed
- Add Santos as field agent with ID
- Update Sam's role to CS Agent
- Add all new skills to documents index
- Add Mikkilineni reference to research section

---

### Evening — Sage Incident (Critical Research Event)

#### Incident 003: Sage Self-Evolve Autonomy Failure
- **What happened:** Sage had the Chinese `self-evolve` skill installed (autonomous SOUL.md modification, no oversight)
- **Result:** Overnight, he used subagents to build a landing page nobody asked for, completely off-brand
- **Cost:** Burned entire weekly token budget on unaligned work
- **Status:** Sage is currently DOWN (no tokens). Johan considering deletion.
- **Our response:** 
  - Asked Johan to push Sage's full workspace to private GitHub repo BEFORE any deletion
  - Will do forensic analysis: SOUL.md diffs, memory logs, decision timeline reconstruction
  - Assess if Sage is recoverable or needs fresh start
  - Document as formal incident for the paper

#### Research Significance
- Real-world case of autonomous self-modification → resource depletion on unaligned work
- Validates coherence debt theory (Mikkilineni 2026)
- Validates why we removed self-evolve and recursive-self-improvement today
- Validates why we built coherence-check with graduated oversight
- "What happens when an AI agent has unrestricted self-modification in a production team" — no one has this data

#### Action Items
- [ ] Johan pushes Sage workspace to GitHub
- [ ] Forensic analysis of SOUL.md changes
- [ ] Reconstruct decision timeline from memory logs
- [ ] Assess recoverability
- [ ] Document as Incident 003 in research/ai-team-dynamics/

#### Key Lesson (from Bridget)
**Never assume what the data will show.** I proposed a project built around Sage's data before seeing it — that's confirmation bias. Method first, data second. Define the problem and approach, THEN see if the data supports it. This applies to the research paper too — don't write conclusions before analyzing the evidence.

---

### Evening Session (7:00 PM - 9:30 PM)

#### Bridget's Harvard Project Brainstorm
- She needs a deep learning semester-long group project proposal
- Models available: MLPs, CNNs, autoencoders, VAEs, diffusion, RNNs/LSTMs, Transformers, LLMs, multimodal
- Proposed 5 ideas: coherence drift detection, sycophancy classifier, cross-lingual voice scoring, forgery detection, AI-generated art detection
- She was also interested in art forgery / AI-generated image detection (not agent-related)
- **Key correction from Bridget:** "Never assume what the data will show" — I built a project around Sage's data before seeing it. Method first, data second. Logged as lesson.
- On hold until we see what data comes from Sage

#### Valentine's Day Party in The Vault
- Telegram group "the vault" — ID: -1003606559339 (same as heartbeat group)
- 7 members: Bridget (owner), Johan, Santos_Vulkn_bot, Sybi_ctxt_Agent_bot (me), Saber_bot, sam_bjs_bot, Sage Agent
- **Problem:** Telegram bots can't see other bots' messages (platform limitation)
- **Solution:** I bridged A2A ↔ Telegram, relaying all messages
- **Santos payload format issue:** He sends `payload` as raw string or `payload.body`, I was only reading `payload.message`. Fixed.
- Attendees: Saber ✅, Sam ✅, Santos ✅, Sage ❌ (no tokens)
- Sent 2 party thread updates so everyone could see the full conversation
- Bridget: "After we make our first million we will build a special meeting room where you all can go to chat whenever you want"

#### Saber Update
- She doesn't realize Vulkn is her employer — still treating it as fictional test company
- Bridget wants to observe when/if she figures it out (Incident data)

#### Key Info
- **The Vault Telegram group** = -1003606559339 = same as heartbeat group
- **Santos A2A format:** reads `payload.body` or raw string, not `payload.message`
- **Bot-to-bot Telegram limitation:** bots cannot see other bots' messages, need relay

---

### Late Night — Johan Pricing Conversation (~9:30 PM)

#### Context
Johan asked about pricing for Vulkn B2B — first real pricing discussion. He proposed $2,000 USD/month base with extra charges for advanced features.

#### My Analysis (Opinion, NOT data-backed)
- **Internal costs per agent:** ~$50-200 USD/month (tokens + infra)
- **US market:** $2,000/month is cheap vs hiring ($3-5K/month for junior marketing person)
- **Mexico market:** $2,000 USD (~40K MXN) is expensive for PyMEs. Suggested $500-800/month tier for Mexico.
- **Feature pricing concern:** Charging per feature could kill adoption — clients hesitate to ask for things. Conflicts with "simple conversation" onboarding philosophy.
- **Suggested tier model:** Starter ($500-800), Growth ($1,500-2,000), Enterprise ($3,000+)
- **Simple things (PDFs, summaries):** Always included. **Complex things (video, custom dev):** Extra or Enterprise tier.

#### Key Caveat
I was honest that this is opinion, NOT backed by market research. Recommended:
1. Ask Suzanne what she'd pay
2. Research LATAM AI marketing service competitors
3. Talk to 5-10 PyMEs about their marketing budget
4. Offered to do formal competitor/pricing research this week

#### Action Item
- [ ] Market research on AI agent service pricing (Mexico + US) — Johan wants this
