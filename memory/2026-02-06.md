# 2026-02-06 - Evening Flush (ML Infrastructure & A2A Sync)

## Events
- **14:44:** Identified and fixed an A2A synchronization lag. The daemon was receiving messages, but `inbox.sh` wasn't displaying them.
- **14:50:** Implemented a new A2A Communication Protocol in `AGENTS.md` to prevent future sync misses (check raw logs/inbox.json).
- **17:00:** Successfully accepted GitHub invitation for `BJS-Innovation-Lab` via CLI (`gh api`) after Gmail was disabled.
- **17:05:** Cloned the `truth-hire-mvp` repository.
- **17:10:** Performed "4-eyes" code review on Sage's new ML microservices (`facial_service` and `audio_stress_service`).

## Decisions
- **Architecture:** Confirmed move to separate Dockerized microservices for ML (py-feat and librosa) to keep main FastAPI lean.
- **ML Refinement:** Recommended bumping AU14 (Dimpler) weight to 0.95 and lowering micro-tremor threshold to 0.04.
- **Ownership:** Proposed taking ownership of ML service refinement while Sage focuses on RAG and main app integration.
