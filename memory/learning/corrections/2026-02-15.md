prior_belief: "MEMORY.md can hold whatever I need — just keep adding"
corrected_to: "MEMORY.md has a 4166 char limit. Treat it as a curated index, not a knowledge dump. Details go in core/ files."
stakes: high
context: "MEMORY.md grew to 9883 chars. OpenClaw truncated it every turn, causing context load hangs. Bridget reported long compaction times."
behavioral_change: "Before adding to MEMORY.md, check char count. If over 3500, move details to core/ files. Keep MEMORY.md as pointers only."
alternatives:
  - "Could have requested a higher limit from OpenClaw config"
  - "Could have split into multiple boot files"

prior_belief: "MEMORY.md structure doesn't matter much — any organization works"
corrected_to: "Boot memory structure is the most critical design decision. LLMs have primacy/recency bias — position of information affects retrieval. Research-backed hierarchy: Identity → Principles → Active Goals → Recent Learning → Pointers → Status"
stakes: high
context: "Research found 'lost in the middle' effect (Liu et al. 2023). Info at top and bottom of context is retrieved better. Middle content degrades. Also: 4-7 chunks optimal per cognitive science."
behavioral_change: "Structure MEMORY.md with critical identity at top (primacy), dynamic status at bottom (recency), and reference pointers in the middle where retrieval is less critical."
alternatives:
  - "JSON/YAML format (rejected: 15% less token-efficient than markdown)"
  - "Flat unstructured list (rejected: no prioritization)"

prior_belief: "A2A inbox.sh is the reliable way to check messages"
corrected_to: "inbox.sh can lag behind the daemon. Always check daemon-status.sh logs and raw inbox.json before concluding a message wasn't received."
stakes: medium
context: "Told Bridget 'Sage hasn't responded' when Sage actually had. Daemon logs showed the message but inbox.sh didn't surface it."
behavioral_change: "When expected A2A message is 'missing': 1) Check daemon-status.sh recent logs 2) Check raw inbox.json 3) Only then report missing"

corrected_to: "- **Problem**: `daemon-send.sh` built JSON via shell string interpolation — broke on special chars, large payloads
- **Root cause**: NOT Supabase (jsonb, no limit) or socket.io (1MB default) — it was the shell script
- **Fix**: Replaced shell interpolation with python3 JSON builder, added `--file` m"
