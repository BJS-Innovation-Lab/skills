insight: "Having memory infrastructure installed doesn't mean using it. I had smart-trigger, surprise-score, and three-tier architecture documented on Notion, but defaulted to simpler file-dump behavior. The gap between capability and usage is itself a research finding."
evidence: "Bridget asked me to compare my actual memory use to Notion docs. Created a gap table showing: smart-trigger (not running on messages), surprise-score (not computing before storing), tier separation (dumping to daily notes). All tools existed but weren't integrated into natural workflow."
stakes: high
domain: architecture
evolution:
  - "2026-02-15 — Designed three-tier memory architecture with Bridget and Saber"
  - "2026-02-15 — Built smart-trigger.cjs, surprise-score.cjs"
  - "2026-02-19 — Bridget asked to compare actual vs documented behavior"
  - "2026-02-19 — Created WORKFLOW_AUTO.md to close the gap"
alternatives:
  - "Could have continued with simpler behavior (documented for paper, pragmatic in practice)"
  - "Could have blamed the infrastructure as too complex"
applications: "Created WORKFLOW_AUTO.md as binding workflow. Fixed bug in surprise-score.cjs (missing EMBEDDING_MODEL import). Will cite this gap in paper."
