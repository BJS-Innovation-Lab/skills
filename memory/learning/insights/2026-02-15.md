insight: "Agent memory without principled design defaults to 'dump everything in one file.' Organic growth guarantees hitting limits. Boot memory must be designed upfront with a char budget and information hierarchy."
evidence: "My MEMORY.md grew organically to 9883 chars (2.4x limit) before breaking. No agent on the team had a structured approach — all were ad hoc."
stakes: high
domain: architecture
evolution:
  - "2026-02-15 12:06 — Discovered MEMORY.md was being truncated"
  - "2026-02-15 12:19 — Bridget asked if structure was optimal, triggered research"
  - "2026-02-15 12:22 — Research confirmed: hierarchical > flat, position matters"
alternatives:
  - "Could have just trimmed and moved on without researching"
  - "Could have raised the limit instead of redesigning"
applications: "Redesigned MEMORY.md structure. Creating template for all agents. Adding audit system."

insight: "Activity is not learning — validated empirically. Saber logged 63 'decisions' but only ~8 were genuine learnings. The rest were config changes, tool calls, and routine actions. Without a stakes gate, learning systems become activity logs."
evidence: "Analyzed Saber's decision log during agentic-learning v2 design. 87% noise rate. Noise entries shared a pattern: no genuine uncertainty, no alternatives considered, no risk articulated."
stakes: high
domain: architecture
evolution:
  - "2026-02-14 — Noticed Saber's log was mostly activity"
  - "2026-02-15 — Quantified: 63 entries, ~8 genuine learnings"
  - "2026-02-15 — Built stakes gate as primary filter in agentic-learning v2"
alternatives:
  - "Numeric importance scale 1-10 (rejected: default-to-5 problem)"
  - "Log everything and filter later (rejected: defeats purpose)"
applications: "Stakes gate is now the primary filter in agentic-learning v2. Three levels: low/medium/high."
