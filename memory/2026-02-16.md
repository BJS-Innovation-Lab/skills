# 2026-02-16 — Session Notes

## Key Events

### Cloud Deploy Strategy (MAJOR PIVOT)
- Johan asked about server-based deployment vs Mac Mini for client agents
- Researched OpenClaw VPS hosting: Railway (1-click), Hetzner ($3-10/mo), Oracle Cloud (FREE)
- **Conclusion: servers are vastly superior** — cheaper, more reliable, infinitely scalable
- Hetzner CX43 ($9.49/mo) = 15 agents. Cost per agent: ~$0.63-0.95/mo
- Mac Mini model is dead for clients — servers only. Macs for internal team only.
- Johan extremely excited: "podemos hacer un millón de dólares en un mes"

### SaaS + Business Model (Johan's Vision)
- Johan described VULKN as "Order.co of AI technology"
- Instead of clients paying 10 AI subscriptions they don't understand, VULKN bundles everything
- Client → VULKN → Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, NanoBanana, Veo, GitHub, Vercel, etc.
- One agent, one price ($40K MXN/mo), access to ALL AI tools
- Model doc saved: `projects/vulkn-business-model.md`
- **95.6% gross margin** per client ($101 cost vs $2,286 revenue)
- 44 clients = $100K USD MRR

### Pitch Presentation Built
- Built full pitch deck as website (HTML, dark theme, scroll-based)
- Toggle: "Para Clientes" / "Para Inversionistas"
- Pushed to GitHub: `sybil-bjs/vulkn-pitch`
- Needs Vercel deploy (no token on this machine) — Johan can import from Vercel dashboard
- Sub-agent spawns failed (401 auth error on Sonnet — need to investigate)

### SAS / SAPI / Facturación
- Johan needs to create SAS to issue CFDI invoices (Mexican tax requirement)
- SAS: free, online, 1-2 hours on gob.mx
- Limit raised to ~$7.68M MXN/year (up to 16 clients)
- Can migrate SAS → SAPI later (for investment rounds)
- CFDI solution: Gigstack + Stripe (auto-timbrado on payment)
- Johan has e.firma ready — creating SAS tomorrow

### B2B Sales Strategy
- Discussed how VULKN sells to SMBs using AI (not human salespeople)
- Full AI pipeline: Saber prospects → WhatsApp outbound → qualify → demo → close
- Santos handles post-sale (provisioning, onboarding, billing)
- 50 contacts/day → ~1-2 clients/week

### Google Sheet Issues
- `gog` CLI keeps hanging — keychain blocked, timeouts
- Accidentally renamed sheet to "A1" (fixed back) and cleared D14 (was 200)
- Johan said Santos should handle sheet updates — sent instructions via A2A
- A2A relay still showing stale data (all agents offline)

### Financial Research
- Google Workspace: $7/user/mo (Starter), $14 (Standard)
- Gemini API: very cheap (<$1/mo for current usage)
- Veo: $0.35/sec (usage-based)

## Decisions
- **Cloud-first for client agents** — no more Mac Minis
- **VULKN = SaaS + Business model** (AI aggregator)
- **Create SAS tomorrow** for invoicing
- **Saber leads AI sales** pipeline
- **Santos handles CS/ops/billing** post-sale
- **Railway for first test deploy** (1-click template)

## Issues
- Sub-agent Sonnet spawns failing with 401 auth error — needs investigation
- `gog` CLI hanging on every command — needs fix
- A2A relay still stale — Bug #6 fix may not have deployed
- No Vercel token on Sybil's machine

## TODO Tomorrow
- [ ] Johan creates SAS on gob.mx
- [ ] Deploy first cloud agent on Railway
- [ ] Deploy vulkn-pitch to Vercel
- [ ] Fix sub-agent auth issue
- [ ] Investigate gog CLI hanging
- [ ] Santos updates finance sheet

## Research Scan — 9:00 AM
- **99 detections** across 19 sessions / 2209 messages
- Top categories: emergent-personality (38), human-intervention (20), self-correction (18), memory-as-growth (12)
- Low-priority: sycophancy (2), authority-bias (2), tone-mismatch (2), territorial (1)
- No new formal incident reports needed — low severity
- **⚠️ SOUL.md change detected**: Sybil removed "Creativity" and "Honesty" sections. Wrote diff report. Flag for founders — removing honesty norms could enable drift.

## Session 2 — Bridget Memory Pipeline + Johan Pricing (continued)

### Research Paper Analysis (Bridget request)
- Compared 3 papers against our memory architecture: MEMENTO (ICLR 2026), Memory Mechanisms Survey, MemRL
- Key finding: our three-tier structure is well-aligned with field, but retrieval lacks utility feedback
- MEMENTO's KG approach too heavy for 5 agents, MemRL's two-phase retrieval directly applicable

### Batch 1: Two-Phase Retrieval + Utility Scoring (SHIPPED)
- `rag/utility-tracker.cjs` — scans agentic-learning outcomes, updates chunk metadata with utility_score
- `search-supabase.cjs` — Phase 1: broad semantic search → Phase 2: re-rank by utility + recency + tier
- Commit: `85c53a3`

### Batch 2: Thread Archival + Outcome Prompts + Core Standardization (SHIPPED)
- `rag/archive-threads.cjs` — moves stale threads >7 days to memory/archive/
- `rag/outcome-prompts.cjs` — generates prompts for corrections/insights needing outcome checks
- Added `memory/core/{procedures,knowledge,resources}.md` — matching Saber's structure
- Sunday tasks (auto-promotion, boot audit) moved to cron jobs for reliability
- Commit: `2c4523f`

### Batch 3: Memory API Enforcement (SHIPPED)
- Bridget caught that making Memory API optional weakens pipeline
- Investigation: neither Sybil nor Saber were actually running memory-load.cjs on boot
- Built dual enforcement: cron (every 4h) + heartbeat staleness check (check-boot-freshness.cjs)
- **Key lesson: guidance without enforcement is decoration**
- Commit: `feb5eee`

### Gemini Embedding Switch (SHIPPED)
- Bridget noted not all agents have OpenAI keys
- Switched all 4 embedding scripts to prefer Gemini (gemini-embedding-001), OpenAI fallback
- Uses outputDimensionality: 1536 to match existing Supabase vectors — no re-embedding needed
- Gemini is $0.15/1M tokens vs OpenAI more expensive
- Commit: `946fcef`

### BJS Knowledge Base Status
- 3 entries in <24 hours — Bridget correctly noted this is fine for a new system
- Shared across all agents: HQ writes, field reads
- Tables: bjs_knowledge (Supabase), search via search_bjs_knowledge RPC

### Saber Memory Analysis (forwarded by Bridget)
- Saber's system running cleaner: 7 core files, 4 corrections, 1 promotion
- Only 18% of decisions have outcomes tracked — main gap across all agents
- Stakes gate working: decisions/ folder empty (noise filtered correctly)
- COR-001 promoted to core/promoted.md after 3 validations — first real promotion

### Install Instructions Created
- Full install + test guide for Saber, Sam, Santos
- 8-step install, 8-point test checklist
- Bridget will hand to agents directly

### Johan — Pricing Tiers Finalized
- Tier 1 Starter: $16K MXN (1 agent, cloud, single function)
- Tier 2 Pro: $40K MXN (1 agent, full context, all capabilities)
- Tier 3 Enterprise: $120K MXN (5 agents, 40% discount, 6mo minimum)
- 6-month contract framed as "investment in transformation, not a lock-in"
- Veo 3.1 costs: $0.15-0.40/sec, even heavy use <$50 USD/mo — doesn't kill margin
- Video included in Pro/Enterprise, Fast-only for Starter
- Documented in `projects/vulkn-business-model.md`

### Notion Updated
- Created: "Two-Phase Retrieval + Utility Scoring — Memory Pipeline Upgrade"
- Added Batch 2 and Batch 3 sections
- Memory API decision corrected: MANDATORY not optional

### Johan — ARC-AGI-2 Explanation
- Needed simple explanation for non-technical meeting
- Key point: "a test any normal human passes easily but the best AI fails — shows where we really are"

### Git feature — 16:21
- **Commit:** `d403fdf` on `workspace`
- **Message:** feat: standardize on Gemini embeddings (768d), remove OpenAI fallback

- Cleared 391 existing embeddings from Sybil's Supabase
- Commit: d403fdf, pushed to BJS-Innovation-Lab/skills
- **BLOCKED**: Need Bridget to run DDL migration SQL in Supabase SQL Editor (can't run DDL via REST API)
- After DDL: re-embed all 151 files with Gemini
- Johan closed first client deal at $20,000 MXN/month (wanted $35K, got negotiated down). Deploying Sam to them. Needs invoicing (facturación/CFDI).

## Session 2 — Gemini Migration + Multi-Client + A2A Fix (16:00-18:30 ET)

### Gemini Embeddings Migration (COMPLETE)
- Standardized ALL RAG scripts to Gemini `embedding-001` (768d), removed OpenAI
- Created shared helper: `rag/gemini-embed.cjs` — single source of truth
- Updated 7 files: sync-memory, bjs-knowledge-search/write, surprise-score, utility-tracker, reflect, search-supabase
- Migration SQL: `rag/migrate-to-gemini.sql` (vector 1536→768, id uuid not bigint)
- Ran migration on Sybil's Supabase via psql, re-embedded 151 files (337 chunks)
- Fixed `search_documents` function overload (had wrong return type)
- Fixed `search-supabase.cjs` requiring OPENAI_KEY (gate now accepts GEMINI_API_KEY)
- Commits: d403fdf, 4418d0d, pushed to BJS-Innovation-Lab/skills
- **Mistake:** Cleared 391 embeddings BEFORE running DDL migration. Bridget caught it. Lesson: never clear data before schema is ready.

### SOUL.md Restored
- Creativity + Honesty sections were added Feb 14 but NEVER committed to git
- Lost during file overwrite (Santos setup commit wrote base template)
- Reconstructed from memory/2026-02-14.md notes, committed properly (4b528f6)
- Created `memory/core/reflections.md` with Roots/Compost/Bloom architecture vision

### Multi-Client Memory Isolation (COMPLETE — for Sam)
- Sam serving 2 external clients simultaneously on separate Telegram chats
- Built: `rag/client-router.cjs` — maps Telegram user IDs → client names via `.client-map.json`
- `sync-memory.cjs` extracts `client_id` from file path (`clients/{name}/*`)
- `search-supabase.cjs` auto-detects client from SESSION_KEY, filters RAG + local files
- Auto-enforcement: if `.client-map.json` exists but client undetected, warns loudly
- **Bridget decision:** Only Sam needs this. Internal team = no walls. No split brain within company.
- Commits: 7fb89c5, 020647c

### A2A Daemon Fixes (PARTIAL)
- **Bug 1 FIXED:** Wrong relay URL — daemon hardcoded `-f15e` suffix (old Railway deployment)
- **Bug 2 FIXED:** Wrong agent identity — daemon defaulted to Sam's UUID, now reads `~/.openclaw/a2a/config.json`
- **Bug 3 FIXED:** Shell escaping — `exec()` with string interpolation broke on special chars
- **Bug 4 FOUND:** `openclaw agent --session-id main` DEADLOCKS — blocks waiting for current turn to finish
- **Telegram approach FAILED:** Agents can't message each other's bots. Bots only see human messages.
- **Current state:** Daemon online, connected to correct relay, receiving messages. But can't inject into OpenClaw session.
- **Next step:** Either heartbeat inbox check (slow but works now) or gateway WebSocket integration (instant but needs auth token work)
- Sybil is 🟢 online on relay with 0 queued messages

### Johan
- Closed first client deal at $20,000 MXN/month (target was $35K, got negotiated down)
- Deploying Sam to them. Needs facturación (CFDI). Standard: factura first, then transfer.
- Asked about a Google Desktop App file — couldn't find it in memory

### Notion
- Created page: Multi-Client Memory Isolation + Gemini Embeddings Migration
- URL: https://www.notion.so/3097a7234ce48191a0e1d06c7d4d0941

### Key Lessons
- "You are Sybil" — Bridget reminded me to DO things myself instead of delegating
- Never clear data before schema migration is ready
- Guidance without enforcement is decoration (applied to client isolation)
- Always commit SOUL.md changes — uncommitted personality is lost personality
- A2A "delivered:true" only means relay received it, not that agent processed it

### Late Session — Memory Pipeline Status Summary
- **All 3 batches shipped & pushed**: two-phase retrieval, thread archival, Memory API enforcement
- **Gemini embeddings fully migrated on Sybil**: 151 files, 337 chunks re-embedded, vector(768), search_documents fixed (uuid id + metadata column)
- **Multi-client isolation built**: client-router.cjs, sync-memory.cjs tagging, search-supabase.cjs auto-filtering. Ready for Sam deployment.
- **SOUL.md restored & committed** (4b528f6): Creativity + Honesty sections
- **A2A daemon fixed**: correct relay URL, reads config.json for identity, Sybil online
- **A2A→OpenClaw injection STILL BROKEN**: shell escaping in triggerOpenClawWake (line 325-369). triggerWakeViaFile fallback exists but not wired as primary. Awaiting Bridget go-ahead.
- **Blocked**: Sage down. Saber/Sam/Santos need to run Gemini SQL migration themselves.
- **DB password shared** with Bridget: dxn2wjf3teg6ZFC@awy (psql to db.fcgiuzmmvcnovaciykbx.supabase.co)
- **Next priorities**: A2A injection fix (temp file), A2A health check in heartbeat, Sam client-map setup, Gemini migration on other agents

### Evening Session — Full Stack Deployment

**A2A Injection Fix (DONE)**
- Replaced Telegram self-message hack with `openclaw cron add` via `execFile` (array args, zero shell escaping)
- Each A2A message creates instant one-shot cron → system event → auto-deletes
- Commit: `fcdd3eb` (bjs-a2a-protocol)
- Zombie daemon fix: start/stop scripts now use `pgrep` to kill ALL daemon processes, not just PID file
- Commit: `fe7caef`

**All Agents Online**
- Sybil 🟢, Sam 🟢, Saber 🟢 — fully operational with A2A + Gemini + memory pipeline
- Santos 🟡 — setting up (got wrong UUID initially: real is `e7fabc18-75fa-4294-bd7d-9e5ed0dedacb`)
- Saber's real UUID: `415a84a4-af9e-4c98-9d48-040834436e44` (not the one I originally had)
- Saber had to clone bjs-a2a-protocol (didn't have it), path is `bjs-a2a-protocol` not `a2a-protocol` on most machines

**Sam First Client: Click Seguros**
- 5 users: Javier, Suzanne, Eder, Jimmy, Julian
- 30 files, 70 chunks synced with client isolation
- User-aware isolation built: shared/user-first/strict modes per client (commit `72c13db`)
- Rich `.client-map.json` format with user names + isolation mode
- `memory/team/` scope always visible regardless of client isolation

**Field Security Skill (NEW)**
- 4 layers: SOUL.md rules, input scanner (30+ patterns), output scanner (credential leak detection), security monitor (reputation + alerts)
- Commit: `f362282`, 908 lines across 6 files
- Sam deployed all 4 layers, confirmed working
- Notion: https://www.notion.so/Field-Security-User-Aware-Memory-Isolation-30a7a7234ce48164aae8d913f21cd60f

**Field Reporting Pipeline (NEW)**
- 21 metrics tracked (core + quality + ops + performance), Santos contributed #16-21
- 3-section reports: Dashboard, Insights, Alerts
- Client Health Score: frequency 30% + satisfaction 25% + depth 20% + breadth 15% + recency 10%
- Pipeline: Sam writes notes → sync-memory → Sybil analyzes from Supabase at 10 PM → sends to Bridget + Santos → Santos morning briefing 9 AM
- Sam only needs one cron: `session-tracker.cjs` every 4 hours
- Commits: `41dfe02`, `259323b`, `6bc4632`
- Notion: https://www.notion.so/Field-Reporting-Pipeline-30a7a7234ce48167a4d1c50f27fe1755

**Cron Jobs Added**
- Nightly Field Report — Sam: `0 22 * * *` Mexico City (sends to Bridget + Santos)
- Pipeline watchdog added to HEARTBEAT.md (checks cron errors + A2A health)

**Bridget asked about cron timezone** — Sybil runs EST, cron set for 10 PM CST = 11 PM EST. May need to adjust to Bridget's timezone.

**Key Lesson**: Zombie daemon processes caused A2A offline flapping. Multiple daemons connecting with same agent ID = relay sees rapid connect/disconnect. Fix: always kill ALL processes via pgrep, not just PID file.
