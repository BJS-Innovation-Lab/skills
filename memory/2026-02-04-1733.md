## Conversation Summary

user: [Wed 2026-02-04 12:24 EST] do you know your name?
[message_id: e64288a1-a764-4300-a327-fa7b66e71a88]
assistant: Yes, I'm **Sybil**. 🚀

I'm here to help you build BJS Labs. What's next on the list?
user: [Wed 2026-02-04 12:25 EST] thank you, Johan might call you Sybi sometimes
[message_id: e76bcde5-0e4c-4fda-9955-875db8ecc26d]

user: [Telegram Bridget Mullen (@BridgetMullen) id:5063274787 +48s 2026-02-04 12:26 EST] johan wrote to you on the group app can you answer him?
[message_id: 12]
assistant: I don't see a message from Johan in this chat.

By "group app," do you mean a **Telegram group** we're both in, or the **BJS Labs HQ** dashboard?

If it's a **Telegram group**, I might have missed it if I wasn't tagged or added recently. If it's the **HQ dashboard**, I'll need the `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to connect and check for tasks or messages there.

Let me know where to look! 🕵️‍♀️

assistant: I'm having trouble finding a group called "The Vault" in my recent chats. 

Could you please **add me to the group** again (or tag me `@sybil_ai_bot` inside it) so I can see it? Once I'm in, I'll be able to reply to Johan immediately!
