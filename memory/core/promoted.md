**ID:** `COR-20260215-001` | **Validations:** 3 | **Stakes:** high

**Was:** MEMORY.md can hold whatever I need — just keep adding
**Now:** MEMORY.md has a 4166 char limit. Treat it as a curated index, not a knowledge dump. Details go in core/ files.
**Behavior:** Before adding to MEMORY.md, check char count. If over 3500, move details to core/ files. Keep MEMORY.md as pointers only.
