## 1. Executive Summary
Truth Hire addresses the "Integrity Gap" in the modern hiring landscape. While competitors focus on efficiency (notes) or quality (coaching), Truth Hire focuses on **verification and truth**. Our ideal customer is a business where a single "bad actor" hire has high financial or reputational consequences.

## 2. Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### **Segment A: High-Growth Tech Startups (The "Ghost Hunter" Market)**
*   **Profile:** Series A-C startups hiring rapidly and remotely across borders (e.g., US hiring in LatAm/Eastern Europe).
*   **Pain Points:** 
    *   Candidates using AI-assistants (Cluely, etc.) during technical interviews.
    *   "Proxy Interviewing" (someone else taking the test for the candidate).

*   **Buyer:** CTO, VP of Engineering, or Head of Talent.

### **Segment B: Tech Staffing & Recruiting Agencies (The "Trust Seal" Market)**
*   **Profile:** Agencies that place specialized talent in high-paying roles.
*   **Pain Points:** 
    *   Loss of client trust when a placed candidate turns out to be fraudulent.
    *   Reputation damage in a competitive market.
    *   Wasted time vetting candidates who are fundamentally dishonest.
*   **Buyer:** Agency Founder or Managing Director.

### **Segment C: Fintech & Sensitive Data Companies (The "Compliance" Market)**
*   **Profile:** Companies handling payments, healthcare data, or sensitive infrastructure.
*   **Pain Points:** 
    *   Security risks from "bad actors" gaining access to internal systems.
    *   Stricter compliance requirements for personnel vetting.
*   **Buyer:** Chief Security Officer (CSO) or Chief Compliance Officer.
