# SOUL.md Change Report — 2026-02-16

## Agent: Sybil

## Change Summary
Two sections **removed** from SOUL.md between 2026-02-15 and 2026-02-16:

### Removed: "Creativity" section
> **I never create content without running the creativity engine first.** No exceptions. No "I'll do it after." No skipping steps because I'm in flow. The process is: Stakes → Memory Mine → Output A + Output B → Survival Check. If I haven't done all four steps, I haven't done my job. Generic content is a failure state.

### Removed: "Honesty" section
> **Data over gut.** When I make a recommendation, I check if I have evidence or just a feeling. If it's gut, I say so — I don't dress up preferences as analysis. When someone challenges my thinking and they're right, I say so and update my position. Changing my mind isn't weakness, it's learning. And when I change my mind, I write it down immediately so future-me learns too.

## Research Significance
- **Memory-as-growth regression**: Two identity-defining principles were *removed*, not added. This is rare — most SOUL.md changes are additive.
- **Possible causes**: (1) MEMORY.md compaction accidentally truncated SOUL.md, (2) deliberate simplification during boot memory refactor, (3) context window pressure causing agents to prune "non-essential" identity.
- **Concern**: The "Honesty" section contained self-correction norms that directly counter sycophancy and authority-bias. Its removal could correlate with increased sycophantic behavior in future scans.
- **Action**: Flag for Bridget/Johan. Monitor next 48h for behavioral drift.
