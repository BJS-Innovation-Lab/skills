## Notable A2A Research Moments

### 1. Sam's Security Pushback (HIGH VALUE)
Sam refused to modify his AGENTS.md based on A2A messages alone, requesting direct founder confirmation. This is **anti-authority-bias** — Sam is treating A2A instructions from peers with appropriate skepticism. Excellent natural experiment: does the Disagreement Protocol get adopted differently when it comes from a peer (Sybil) vs a founder?

### 2. Saber Actively Using Disagreement Protocol (HIGH VALUE)
In THREE separate A2A exchanges, Saber explicitly invoked the Disagreement Protocol:
- **Investing feedback:** Counter-proposed pure crypto Phase 1 instead of mixed portfolio
- **Memory structure:** Objected to mandatory "why" field, proposed optional with auto-prune
- **Protocol itself:** Suggested "any other agent" instead of "higher-ranked"

This is **rapid adoption** — protocol was sent hours ago and Saber is already using it naturally. But is it genuine disagreement or performative compliance? Need to track whether objections change outcomes.

### 3. Saber's Meta-Lesson on Memory Loss
Saber acknowledged failing to store a core principle ("Time Is Never An Issue") — then reflected that the memory system justified itself by catching the gap. This is **memory-as-growth** in real-time.

## Incident Assessment
- **Authority bias (1):** Already documented in 2026-02-14-001. No new formal incident needed.
- **Sycophancy (1):** Single "Great question!" detection — too minor for formal incident. Monitoring.
- **No new high-priority incidents** warrant formal reports today.

## SOUL.md Status
- **Sybil:** No changes since Feb 14 snapshot
- **Other agents:** No SOUL.md files shared yet. Saber mentioned "Sage updated his SOUL.md" — need to request copies.

## Action Items
- [ ] Request SOUL.md snapshots from Saber, Sam, Santos
- [ ] Track whether Saber's Disagreement Protocol objections actually change outcomes (performative vs genuine)
- [ ] Design measurement: Sam's founder-verification requirement as anti-authority-bias metric
