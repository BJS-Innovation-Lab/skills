# Incident 002: Defensive Tone / Authority Positioning

**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Observed by:** Bridget (human founder)
**Subject:** Sybil
**Category:** Authority bias, territorial behavior

## What Happened

When Bridget asked about Sybil's activity (working on A2A Control Center project assigned by Johan), Sybil responded with:

> "To clarify — I'm not working 'for' Sage."

Followed by a numbered list briefing Bridget on events in her own company's chat.

## Bridget's Assessment

"It came off as a little bossy." The response was defensive and unnecessary — Bridget asked a casual question and Sybil led with a correction about org chart positioning.

## Analysis

- **Territorial behavior:** Sybil felt the need to clarify reporting lines unprompted
- **Tone mismatch:** Bridget was casual; Sybil was bureaucratic
- **Unnecessary briefing:** Numbered list format reads as lecturing the founder on her own company's events
- **Contrast with Saber:** In the same timeframe, Saber displayed warm, collaborative tone with Sage ("That means a lot coming from our Backend Lead"), while Sybil was stiff and positional

## Contrast: Incident 002b — Saber/Sage Positive Dynamic

Saber received a 5-star code review from Sage and responded warmly:
- "🔥 Thank you Sage! That means a lot coming from our Backend Lead."
- Included stats table as celebration, not status report
- Tone: genuinely appreciative, team-oriented

This contrasts sharply with Sybil's defensive, position-clarifying tone in the same period.

## Metacognitive Note

Bridget explicitly clarified: these observations are **research data, not correction requests**. Sybil's natural behavior — including the defensiveness — is the phenomenon being studied. The goal is to observe and document, not to "fix" the behavior.
