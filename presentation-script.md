# Presentation Script: From Strings to Insights
## The Modern API Research Workflow

### Slide 1: Title - The Modern API: Solving Wicked Problems with Data
**Visual:** [Academic Technology Graphic: Greek Bust to Binary]
**Speaker Notes:**
"Welcome everyone. Today, we aren't just talking about technology; we're talking about how we see the world. We’re going to look at APIs—not just as code, but as the primary tool for solving 'wicked problems.' A wicked problem, like climate change or systemic bias, is too big for one person to see. But through APIs, we can 'sense' the data of the entire world at once."

### Slide 2: What is an API? (The Menu Analogy)

**Speaker Notes:**
"Think of an API as a restaurant menu. You don't walk into the kitchen and start rummaging through the fridge—that’s the server. Instead, you look at the menu (the documentation), you place an order (the request), and the waiter (the API) brings the food (the data) back to your table. It is a contract for information."

### Slide 3: Who uses them and why?

**Speaker Notes:**
"Traditionally, APIs were for developers. But today, they are for curators and researchers. Why? To move from 'browsing' to 'sensing.' Browsing is looking at one painting at a time. Sensing is asking a database: 'Show me every object acquired from 1920 to 1940 that contains copper.' That is research at scale."

### Slide 4: The Data Ecosystem: Open Access

**Speaker Notes:**
"Harvard Art Museums, The Met, and Cleveland aren’t just buildings; they are open data nodes. Open access is a civic duty. By opening their collections, they allow us to do research that was impossible 20 years ago. We can now compare representation and history across global institutions in milliseconds."

### Slide 5: The Research Cluster (Beyond Art)
**Visual:** [Logos of Harvard Library Cloud, OpenAlex, World Bank]
**Speaker Notes:**
"To solve a wicked problem, we need more than art. We need context.
- **Harvard Library Cloud:** Access to the world’s bibliographic record.
- **OpenAlex:** The 'Global Brain' of research papers.
- **World Bank API:** Real-time global poverty and climate data.
APIs allow us to cross-reference these sources to find the 'hidden' story."

### Slide 6: Level 1: The Archaic URL String
**Visual:** [A long, complex URL: https://api.harvardartmuseums.org/object?apikey=...&q=sun]
**Speaker Notes:**
"This is the 'Old Way.' In 2015, you had to learn the computer's language. You had to craft these long, ugly strings. It was precise, but it was manual, slow, and easy to break. This is the plumbing."

### Slide 7: Level 2: The Connectors (Google Sheets)
**Visual:** [Screenshot of Google Sheets populating with museum data]
**Speaker Notes:**
"Then came the connectors. Tools like the Google API Connector allowed us to pull data directly into rows and columns. This made it feel like a spreadsheet, which is better for humans, but still requires us to do all the heavy lifting of sorting and counting."

### Slide 8: Level 3: The Modern AI Flow (The Demo)
**Visual:** [Graphic of a glowing data stream cutting through a web of icons]
**Speaker Notes:**
"Today, we have reached Level 3. The computer has learned *our* language. Instead of writing code to get data, we ask a human question. We tell the AI: 'Connect to the API, get the data, and write a script to prove your analysis.' We are moving from being 'Data Gatherers' to 'Insight Architects.'"

### Slide 9: Conclusion
**Speaker Notes:**
"The API provides the raw truth. The code provides mathematical accuracy. And you, the researcher, provide the curiosity. Let's look at how this works in practice."
