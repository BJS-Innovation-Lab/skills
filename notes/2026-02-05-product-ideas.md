## 1. Enterprise Landing Page v2 (A/B Test)

**Current State:** "Military grade" feel, intense, focuses on catching liars.

**New Version Concept:**
- **Tone:** Softer, warmer, trust-focused
- **Target Audience:** American companies who see themselves as "the good guys"
- **Visual Style:** Muted tones, warm feeling
- **Messaging Reframe:**
  - ❌ "Find the liars"
  - ✅ "Find the most truthful people"
  - ✅ "Identify reliable, trustworthy candidates"
  - ✅ "Build teams you can count on"

**Goal:** A/B test both landing pages to see which converts better.

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Sam: Design softer landing page mockup
- [ ] Sage: Set up A/B testing infrastructure
- [ ] Sybil: Help with copy/messaging strategy

## 2. Consumer App ("Truth Check" / Working Title)

### Target Audience
- 20-somethings (avg age ~22)
- Use cases: Checking if boyfriend/girlfriend is lying, friend conversations
- Appeal: Fun, novelty, almost like a toy
- Low barrier to entry - grab and use

### Core Features

**Recording:**
- Record in-person conversations
- Record during phone calls
- Import voice messages
- (Future) In-person service interactions (plumber, salesperson, etc.)

**Analysis Output:**
- Fun graphic interface with conversation transcript
- Interactive - highlights less truthful sections
- Tap/pop into sections for deeper analysis
- Cool, fun, bright graphics BUT also minimal/clean

**User Profiles:**
- Create profiles for people (boyfriend, friend, etc.)
- Ongoing analysis tied to each person
- Track patterns over time
- Build behavioral profiles (like Subject feature in prototype)

### Design Inspiration
- **Location:** Bridget's Notion → Lie Detector → UI Inspiration
- **Vibe:** Cool, fun, bright but minimal
- Modern, young, approachable

### Action Items:
- [ ] Sybil: Pull UI inspiration images from Notion
- [ ] Sam: Create initial mockups based on inspiration
- [ ] Sage: Plan backend architecture for user profiles + phone call recording
- [ ] All: Discuss technical feasibility of phone call recording (platform limitations?)

## Questions to Discuss

1. **Naming:** What do we call the consumer app? (Truth Check? Trust Score? Vibe Check?)
2. **Phone Recording:** iOS/Android limitations on call recording - need research
3. **Privacy:** How do we handle consent for recording others?
4. **Monetization:** Freemium? Subscription? Per-analysis?
5. **MVP Scope:** Start with just voice recordings, add phone calls later?

Bridget's key quotes:
- "You are not finding the liars, but maybe you are finding the most truthful people, people you can rely on"
- "Very cool and fun. Maybe some bright graphics, but also like very minimal"
- "Almost like it's a toy" - novelty appeal for young users
- "Ongoing idea and analysis of what that person's saying and how they're acting"
