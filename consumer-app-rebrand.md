# Consumer App Rebrand - Minimal Tool Positioning

**Date:** 2026-02-08  
**Based on:** Bridget's original vision (Feb 5)

---

## The Vision

**Not a party game. A personal tool.**

Think: Voice Memos meets Find My meets... trust.

A clean, minimal utility that 20-somethings use to get a "read" on conversations. Low-key. Personal. Almost like checking the weather - quick, useful, part of your routine.

---

## Core Concept

### What It Is
A minimal voice analysis tool that helps you understand conversations better.

### What It's NOT
- ❌ A party game
- ❌ A prank app
- ❌ A polygraph simulator
- ❌ Aggressive or accusatory

### Vibe
- 🧘 Calm, clean, minimal
- 🎨 Modern but not flashy
- 🔧 Tool-like, utilitarian
- ✨ Subtle delight in interactions

---

## App Personality

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Tone** | Curious, not accusatory |
| **Feel** | Like a smart assistant, not a lie detector |
| **UI** | iOS-native clean, lots of white space |
| **Language** | "Analysis" not "detection" / "Insights" not "lies" |
| **Branding** | Subtle, minimal logo - no police/interrogation vibes |

---

## Name Options (Minimal/Tool Feel)

| Name | Vibe | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **Vibe** | Ultra minimal | "Check the vibe" |
| **Clarity** | Clean, professional | Clear communication |
| **Signal** | Tech-forward | Signal vs noise |
| **Read** | Simple, intuitive | "Get a read on someone" |
| **Nota** | Minimal, modern | Latin for "note/mark" |
| **Candor** | Honest, direct | About truthfulness |
| **Veritas** | Classic | Latin for "truth" |
| **TrueVoice** | Descriptive | Voice + truth |

**My pick:** "Vibe" or "Read" - short, modern, non-threatening

---

## Core Features (Minimal MVP)

### 1. Quick Record
- One-tap recording
- Clean waveform visualization
- Auto-transcription

### 2. Analysis View
- Scrollable transcript
- Subtle highlights on "interesting" sections
- Tap to expand for details
- No aggressive "LIE DETECTED" - more like "🤔 worth noting"

### 3. People Profiles
- Add people you talk to regularly
- See patterns over time
- "Boyfriend", "Roommate", "That guy from Tinder"
- Builds behavioral baseline

### 4. Import
- Voice messages (WhatsApp, iMessage, etc.)
- Audio files
- (Future) Call recording integration

---

## UI Direction

### Color Palette
- **Primary:** Clean white/light gray
- **Accent:** One subtle color (soft blue? mint? coral?)
- **Text:** Dark gray, not pure black
- **Highlights:** Soft, not alarming (amber/yellow, not red)

### Typography
- San Francisco (iOS) / Roboto (Android)
- Clean, readable, lots of breathing room
- Big headers, comfortable text size

### Components
- Minimal chrome
- Floating action button for record
- Card-based layout for recordings
- Smooth animations, nothing jarring

### NO:
- ❌ Police/detective imagery
- ❌ Red "lie" indicators
- ❌ Alarm sounds
- ❌ Aggressive copy
- ❌ Polygraph visuals

### YES:
- ✅ Subtle waveforms
- ✅ Clean cards
- ✅ Soft highlights
- ✅ Gentle animations
- ✅ Calm notification sounds

## Copy/Language Guidelines

### Instead of... → Use...

| Don't Say | Say Instead |
|-----------|-------------|
| Lie detected | Something worth noting |
| Deception score | Confidence level |
| Catching lies | Understanding conversations |
| Interrogate | Analyze |
| Suspect | Person / Contact |
| Alert / Warning | Insight / Note |
| Truth percentage | Clarity score |

### Taglines (Minimal)
- "Know your conversations"
- "Listen closer"
- "Clarity in every word"
- "Understand what's really being said"

---

## Legal/Marketing Split

### In the App (Minimal, Tool-Like)
- Clean, professional UI
- Neutral language
- No entertainment disclaimers cluttering the experience
- Focused utility feel

### In App Store / Marketing (Entertainment Framing)
- "For entertainment purposes"
- Disclaimers in description
- Terms of Service cover legal bases
- Fun, approachable marketing tone

### Why This Works
- App feels premium and useful
- Legal protection in the store listing and ToS
- Users get the tool they want
- We stay protected

## Profile Feature (Track People Over Time)

### Add a Person
- Name (or nickname)
- Photo (optional)
- Relationship tag: Partner, Friend, Family, Work, Other

### Person View
- List of all conversations with them
- "Patterns" summary (after 3+ recordings)

### Insights Over Time
- "Tends to be less clear when discussing [topic]"

- "Baseline clarity: High"

## Monetization (Tool Model)

| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | 3 recordings/month, basic analysis |
| **Pro** | $4.99/mo | Unlimited recordings, people profiles, history |
| **Pro Annual** | $29.99/yr | Same as Pro, 50% savings |

**Why subscription for a tool:**
- Tools = ongoing value = subscription makes sense
- Party games = one-time purchase or IAP
- This positions us as utility, not novelty

---

## Competitive Positioning

| Us (Tool) | Party Game Apps |
|-----------|----------------|
| Daily/weekly use | Occasional use |
| Personal, private | Social, shared |
| Minimal UI | Fun/flashy UI |
| Subscription | One-time + IAP |
| Higher LTV | Lower LTV |
| Serious utility | Entertainment |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Get UI inspiration images** from Bridget's Notion
2. **Create mood board** based on minimal/tool direction
3. **Design 3-5 key screens** in new style
4. **Test names** with target audience
5. **Update legal copy** to match tool (not party game) positioning

---

## Questions for Bridget

1. Can you share the Notion UI inspiration images?
2. Preference on name direction? (Vibe, Read, Signal, etc.)
3. Color accent preference? (Blue = trust, Mint = calm, Coral = modern)
4. Start with iOS-only or both platforms?
5. Call recording feature - still a priority for MVP?

*This is a pivot from party game → personal tool. The legal disclaimers still apply in marketing/ToS, but the app experience is clean and professional.*
