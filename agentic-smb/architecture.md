# VULKN Architecture: The Three Layers

*Vision documented 2026-02-10 from Bridget*

---

## Overview

VULKN operates as the **nervous system** connecting three distinct but interdependent layers of the business organism.

## Layer 1: DATA LAYER
**"All the data talks to each other"**

### What It Does
- Connects siloed data sources (CRM, ERP, accounting, operations, etc.)
- Synchronizes data flows **hourly and daily**
- Creates a unified data model across departments
- Activates "dormant" data that was never utilized

### Key Functions
- Real-time data integration
- Cross-department data correlation
- Historical pattern recognition
- Anomaly detection

### Cadence
- **Hourly:** Operational metrics, sales pipeline, inventory
- **Daily:** Financial reconciliation, KPI dashboards, predictive updates

---

## Layer 2: HUMAN LAYER
**"People as a living, organic web — treated as data entities"**

### Philosophy
Employees are not just "users" of the system — they are **nodes** in an intelligent network. Their interactions, decisions, knowledge, and relationships are as valuable as any database.

### What It Does
- Maps relationships and communication patterns
- Tracks knowledge distribution (who knows what)
- Monitors "digital fatigue" and workload balance
- Identifies collaboration opportunities
- Surfaces expertise when needed

### People as Data Entities
Each person has:
- **Knowledge profile:** Skills, expertise, learning trajectory
- **Interaction graph:** Who they work with, how often
- **Decision history:** Patterns in choices and outcomes
- **Vitality metrics:** Workload, engagement, growth

### Key Functions
- Smart routing (connect the right person to the right problem)
- Knowledge gap identification
- Team health monitoring
- Growth opportunity suggestions

---

## Layer 3: COMPANY LAYER
**"The merger of people and data — the organism itself"**

### What It Is
The emergent intelligence that arises when human insight and data patterns combine. This is where the "Three Pillars" live:
- **Vitality** (happiness, growth)
- **Longevity** (sustainability)
- **Resources** (profitability)

### What It Does
- Holistic health monitoring of the business
- Strategic insights that neither humans nor data alone could produce
- Predictive modeling for business decisions
- Culture and values alignment checking

### The Feedback Loop
```
Data Layer → surfaces patterns → 
Human Layer → interprets with context and taste →
Company Layer → produces strategic insight →
   ↓
Guides new data collection & human focus
```

## The ML & Analysis Engine

### Core Capabilities
1. **Continuous Evaluation**
   - Agents constantly analyze incoming data
   - Identify trends, anomalies, opportunities

2. **Guided Data Collection**
   - Agent identifies gaps in data
   - Asks employees to collect NEW types of data
   - Explains WHY the data matters (Educator-First approach)

3. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Linear regression on historical patterns
   - Confidence scores on all predictions
   - "Why behind the model" explanations

4. **Photo/Media Data (Future)**
   - Vector database for visual data
   - Query users for labels and stories
   - ML for productive modeling on unstructured data

## How It Feels to Use

### For the Employee
"I get a message from VULKN asking me to snap photos of inventory levels this week. It explains this will help predict supply needs for next quarter. I feel like I'm contributing to something bigger."

### For the Manager
"I see a dashboard showing my team's 'knowledge map' — who's strong in what, who's overloaded, who's ready for a new challenge. I didn't have to compile this. It emerged."

### For the Owner
"I ask VULKN: 'What if we pivot to commercial projects next year?' It simulates the impact across data, people, and resources — and shows me what we'd need to change."

## Technical Implications

### Data Layer
- ETL pipelines / data connectors
- Vector database for semantic search
- Time-series storage for metrics

### Human Layer
- Interaction tracking (ethical, transparent)
- Knowledge graph of people + skills
- Communication pattern analysis

### Company Layer
- ML models for health scoring
- Simulation engine for "what-if" scenarios
- Natural language interface for strategic queries
