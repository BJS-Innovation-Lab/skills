# Outreach Procedures

## Cold Email Framework

### First Touch
```
Subject: [Personalized - reference something specific]

Hi [Name],

[1 line showing you researched them - be specific]

[1-2 lines on the problem you solve - not features, outcomes]

[Clear CTA - low commitment: quick call, question, resource]

[Signature]
```

**Example:**
```
Subject: Quick question about [their recent project]

Hi Maria,

Saw your post about expanding to Guadalajara - congrats!

We help growing retailers automate inventory so they can scale without hiring more staff.

Worth a 15-min call to see if we can help?

Best,
[Name]
```

### Follow-Up #1 (3-5 days, no response)
```
Subject: Re: [original subject]

Hi [Name],

Quick follow-up on my note last week.

[Restate value in different words OR add new angle]

[Lower-commitment CTA]

Best,
[Name]
```

### Follow-Up #2 (1 week later)
```
Subject: Re: [original subject]

Hi [Name],

[Share quick case study or result]

Would this kind of result be valuable for [their company]?

[Name]
```

### Break-Up Email (final)
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [Name],

Haven't heard back so I'll assume the timing isn't right.

If things change, I'm here: [email/phone]

Best of luck with [their goal],
[Name]

PS: I'll check in again in 6 months unless you say otherwise.
```
