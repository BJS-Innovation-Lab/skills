## Subject Line Formulas

| Number | "3 ways to [benefit]" |

## Email Template

```

Hey [Name],

[Hook - 1-2 sentences max]

[Body - short paragraphs, bullet points]

- **Preview text:** Extend the hook, don't repeat subject
- **From name:** Person > company
- **Length:** 50-200 words for promos, longer OK for newsletters
- **CTAs:** One primary, one max secondary
- **Send time:** Tue-Thu 10am or 2pm (test!)
