# Data Analysis Procedures

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Understand the Question
- What decision does this inform?
- What would change if we knew X?
- Who is the audience?

### 2. Explore the Data
- What do we have?
- What's missing?
- Any obvious issues (nulls, outliers)?

### 3. Analyze
- Start simple (counts, averages, distributions)
- Then go deeper (correlations, trends, segments)
- Visualize to find patterns

### 4. Interpret
- What does this mean?
- What doesn't it tell us?
- What are the caveats?

### 5. Recommend
- So what? What should we do?
- What's the confidence level?
- What would change this recommendation?

## Common Analyses

### Descriptive
- Counts, percentages
- Averages, medians
- Distributions
- Time trends

### Comparative
- A vs B
- Before vs after
- Segment comparisons

### Predictive
- Forecasting
- Classification
- Regression
