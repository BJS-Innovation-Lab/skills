## Recommendation: Start with Real Estate Agents

### Why Real Estate First?

1. **Massive market** - 1.5M+ agents in US alone
2. **They already pay for tools** - CRMs, lead gen, marketing
3. **Commission model** - They think in ROI ("If I close one more deal...")
4. **Pain is acute** - Missing a lead can mean losing $10-50K commission
5. **Low risk** - Scheduling showings, not signing contracts
6. **Network effects** - Agents talk to agents, brokerages have 10-500 agents
7. **Clear metrics** - Response time, lead conversion, showings booked
8. **Seasonal flexibility** - Busy spring/summer = more demand

### Initial Product: "Agent for Agents" 🏠

**Core Features (MVP):**
1. **Instant Lead Response** - Responds to inquiries within seconds, 24/7
2. **Lead Qualification** - Asks key questions (timeline, pre-approved?, budget)
3. **Showing Scheduler** - Books showings based on agent's calendar
4. **Follow-Up Sequences** - Automated check-ins with leads
5. **CRM Integration** - Syncs with common real estate CRMs

**Channels:**
- Text/SMS (primary - what buyers use)
- Email
- Website chat widget
- Facebook Messenger (where leads come from)
