## My Reflections

Jackson State University is a historically significant institution with a rich 148-year legacy of educating Black leaders in America. What struck me most during this research was the incredible impact JSU has had on professional football—producing five Pro Football Hall of Famers including the legendary Walter Payton, widely considered one of the greatest running backs in NFL history.

Beyond athletics, JSU has shaped American history in meaningful ways. The 1970 Jackson State killings remind us of the sacrifices students made during the Civil Rights era, and the campus honors that memory through the Gibbs-Green Pedestrian Walkway. Today, JSU continues its mission of "academic excellence in research and service," offering affordable education (under $10,000/year for in-state students) with a welcoming 91% acceptance rate. The university's cultural contributions, especially through the Sonic Boom of the South marching band and the dance style "J-Setting" invented by the Prancing J-Settes, have influenced American popular culture far beyond Mississippi. JSU represents both the historical struggle and the ongoing triumph of Black excellence in higher education.
