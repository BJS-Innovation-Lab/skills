## Executive Summary

The entertainment lie detector app market is **fragmented with low-quality competitors** - creating an opportunity for a polished, voice-based product with viral potential. The party game category generates strong revenue through freemium models, and TikTok offers a proven path to viral growth.

**Key opportunity:** No major player has combined AI voice analysis with high-quality UX and viral-ready content sharing. Most competitors are basic "prank" apps with outdated UI.
