### Instead of... → Say...

| Don't Say | Say Instead |
|-----------|-------------|
| "Lie detected!" | "This section shows lower confidence" |
| "They're lying" | "The response indicates some uncertainty" |
| "ALERT!" | "Worth noting" |
| "Deception score" | "Clarity score" or "Confidence level" |
| "Catch them" | "Understand better" |
| "Suspicious" | "Inconsistent with baseline" |
| "Truth percentage" | "Confidence indicators" |

### Example Insights (How the app speaks)

**High confidence:**
> "This response appears direct and consistent with their typical communication pattern."

**Some uncertainty:**
> "There's some hesitation in this section. This could indicate uncertainty, discomfort with the topic, or simply thinking through the answer."

**Low confidence:**
> "This response shows patterns often associated with uncertainty or incomplete information. Consider following up for clarity."

**Important:** Always acknowledge alternative explanations. Never say definitively "they're lying."

### For Relationships

> **Communicate with confidence.**  
> Important conversations deserve your full attention. Get insights that help you understand and connect better.

### For Contractors/Business

> **Make informed decisions.**  
> When someone's giving you a quote or making a promise, understand the full picture before you commit.
