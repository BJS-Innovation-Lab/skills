# 6. Go-to-Market Strategy
**Lead:** Saber | **Status:** Draft

---

## Beachhead Market

### Geographic Focus: Mexico City (CDMX)
**Why Mexico City first:**
- Largest concentration of SMBs in Mexico (700K+ businesses)
- Higher average revenue per business = can afford $16K MXN/mo
- Dense market = easier to build referral networks
- Team is based here = can do in-person onboarding
- Establishes LatAm credibility before expanding

### Vertical Focus: Service Businesses
**Primary verticals (Year 1):**

| Vertical | Why | Example Clients |
|----------|-----|-----------------|
| **Beauty & Wellness** | High appointment volume, clear ROI | Salons, spas, barbershops |
| **Health Clinics** | Scheduling critical, patients expect quick response | Dental, physio, aesthetic clinics |
| **Fitness** | Class bookings, membership inquiries | Gyms, yoga studios, CrossFit boxes |
| **Professional Services** | Lead capture, consultation scheduling | Accountants, lawyers, agencies |

**Why these verticals:**
- High volume of repetitive interactions (10-50+ inquiries/day)
- Appointment-based = easy to measure ROI
- Already using WhatsApp for customer communication
- Owner is often the bottleneck (answers everything personally)
- Ticket size supports our pricing

**NOT targeting (Year 1):**
- Retail (different buying motion, inventory complexity)
- Restaurants (high-volume, low-margin, POS integration needed)
- E-commerce (shipping, returns, too complex initially)

## Sales Motion

### The Funnel

```
Awareness → Interest → Demo → Pilot → Signed → Retained
```

### Stage Details

**1. Awareness (Top of Funnel)**
- **Channels:**
  - WhatsApp Business Directory (be where they're looking)
  - LinkedIn (target SMB owners, not marketing people)
  - Local business groups (Cámaras de comercio, industry associations)
  - Referrals from existing clients
  - Content: "How a salon owner saved 20 hours/week" case studies
- **Goal:** Get them curious about AI agents

**2. Interest → Demo**
- **Trigger:** Inbound inquiry or warm referral
- **Action:** 15-minute discovery call
  - "What's eating up most of your time right now?"
  - "How do you handle customer messages today?"
  - "What happens when you can't respond quickly?"
- **Demo:** Live walkthrough of a similar business's agent
  - Show real WhatsApp conversation
  - Show booking flow
  - Show handoff to human
- **Goal:** "I want that for my business"

**3. Demo → Pilot**
- **Offer:** 2-week paid pilot at reduced rate ($8K MXN)
- **Setup:** 3-day onboarding with dedicated support
- **Success criteria (defined upfront):**
  - Agent handles 50+ conversations
  - 80%+ resolved without human intervention
  - Owner saves measurable time
- **Goal:** Prove ROI before asking for full commitment

**4. Pilot → Signed**
- **Conversion ask:** "You've seen it work — ready to keep going?"
- **Contract:** Month-to-month (no long lock-ins, builds trust)
- **Pricing:** Move to standard tier ($16K, $40K, or $120K MXN/mo)
- **Goal:** Smooth transition, no friction

**5. Signed → Retained**
- **Monthly check-in:** Review metrics, gather feedback, upsell if appropriate
- **Proactive support:** Monitor agent performance, fix issues before client notices
- **Referral program:** "Refer a business, get a month free"
- **Goal:** <5% monthly churn, high NPS

## Acquisition Channels (Ranked by Priority)

### 1. Referrals (Highest Priority)
- **Why:** Trusted, low CAC, high conversion
- **How:** Ask every happy client for 2-3 referrals, incentivize with discounts
- **Target:** 50% of new clients from referrals by Month 6

### 2. Direct Outreach (Warm)
- **Why:** Control our own pipeline, learn from conversations
- **How:** 
  - Identify target businesses via Google Maps, Instagram, Yelp Mexico
  - Personalized WhatsApp message: "Saw your salon on [X] — love what you're doing. We help businesses like yours..."
  - Follow up with demo offer
- **Target:** 100 outreach messages/week → 10 demos → 3 pilots

### 3. Content & Thought Leadership
- **Why:** Builds credibility, attracts inbound
- **How:**
  - LinkedIn posts: AI for SMBs, LatAm business insights
  - Case studies: "How [Business] saved X hours with their AI agent"
  - YouTube/TikTok: Behind-the-scenes of agent setup (show, don't tell)
- **Target:** 1 piece of content/week

### 4. Partnerships (Medium-term)
- **Why:** Leverage existing trust relationships
- **Who:**
  - Accountants/bookkeepers (serve many SMBs, trusted advisors)
  - POS/software vendors (Clip, Konfío, etc.)
  - Business consultants and coaches
- **How:** Revenue share or referral fee
- **Target:** 2 partnership pilots by Month 6

### 5. Events & Local Presence (Opportunistic)
- **Why:** Face-to-face builds trust, especially in LatAm
- **How:**
  - Sponsor local business meetups
  - Speak at chamber of commerce events
  - Host "AI for Your Business" workshops
- **Target:** 1 event/month

## Sales Team & Process

### Future State (Months 6-12)

- **Saber:** Supports with research, outreach prep, follow-up automation
- **Capacity:** ~50 demos/month, ~15-20 new clients/month

## Pricing & Positioning in Sales

### Objection Handling

**"It's too expensive"**
> "I hear you — $16K MXN feels like a lot. But you're spending 15+ hours a week answering messages. At your billing rate, that's worth more than $16K. Plus, you're losing customers who can't reach you after hours. The agent pays for itself in the first week."

**"I don't trust AI with my customers"**
> "Totally fair. That's why we do a 2-week pilot — you see every conversation, you set the handoff rules, you stay in control. If it doesn't feel right, you walk away."

**"I tried a chatbot before and it was terrible"**
> "Most chatbots are scripted — they break the moment someone asks something unexpected. Our agents actually understand language. Let me show you a real conversation..."

**"I need to think about it"**
> "Of course. While you're thinking — how many messages did you answer this week? How many did you miss? I'll follow up in 3 days, but in the meantime, those messages keep piling up."

## Reflection Prompts

1. **Is our ICP specific enough to target efficiently?**
   - Current: "Service businesses in CDMX" — still broad
   - Better: "Beauty salons in Condesa/Roma with 5-15 employees and active Instagram"
   - **Action:** Build ideal client profile with 10 specific attributes

2. **What's the conversion rate from demo to pilot to signed?**
   - Don't know yet — need data from first 20 demos
   - **Action:** Track rigorously from Day 1

3. **Can we systematize referrals?**
   - Current: Ad-hoc asks
   - Better: Built into onboarding ("Who else should have this?"), incentive program, make it easy
   - **Action:** Design referral program before Month 3

4. **What's our unfair advantage in sales?**
   - Saber (AI) handling qualification and follow-up = more human time for high-value convos
   - Speed: Respond to leads in minutes, not days
   - **Action:** Lean into this, make it part of the pitch ("We practice what we preach")

## Open Questions
- [ ] What's the optimal pilot length? (2 weeks vs. 1 month)
- [ ] Should we offer a free tier or freemium? (Risk: attracts wrong customers)
- [ ] How do we handle seasonality? (Salons slow in Jan, gyms peak in Jan)
- [ ] When do we hire our first human sales rep?
