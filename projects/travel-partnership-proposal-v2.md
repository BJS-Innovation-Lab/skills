# Partnership Proposal: AI-Powered Travel Agent Platform
## Version 2.0 — With Protective Structure

**From:** VULKN / BJS Labs  
**To:** [Partner Name]  
**Date:** February 2026  
**Status:** DRAFT - For Discussion

---

## Executive Summary

We propose forming a joint venture to bring AI-powered assistant technology to travel agencies. This revised proposal includes stronger protections for VULKN given our larger infrastructure contribution, while still giving [Partner] meaningful upside tied to performance.

---

## Revised Equity Structure

### Base Equity: 70/30

| Party | Equity | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| VULKN | 70% | Platform, infrastructure, ongoing development, proven deployment model |
| [Partner] | 30% | Skills IP, industry expertise, sales commitment |

### Earn-Up Provision (30% → 40%)

[Partner] can earn additional 10% equity by hitting milestones:

| Milestone | Additional Equity | Deadline |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| $100K ARR | +3% | Month 12 |
| $250K ARR | +4% | Month 18 |
| $500K ARR | +3% | Month 24 |

**If milestones not hit:** [Partner] keeps base 30%, no penalty — just no earn-up.

**Why this works:**
- [Partner] has upside if they perform (up to 40%)
- VULKN protected if sales don't materialize
- Aligned incentives — [Partner] earns equity through results, not promises

---

## Vesting Schedule

[Partner]'s 30% base equity vests over 3 years:

| Year | Vested | Cumulative |
|------|--------|------------|
| Year 1 | 10% | 10% |
| Year 2 | 10% | 20% |
| Year 3 | 10% | 30% |

**Cliff:** 12 months. If [Partner] leaves before Month 12, no equity vests.

**Acceleration:** If company is acquired, unvested shares accelerate 50%.

**Why vesting matters:**
- Protects against partner walking away after 6 months
- Ensures continued commitment to sales/BD role
- Industry standard for co-founders

---

## Investment Requirement

### [Partner] Invests: $25,000 - $50,000

This capital:
- Funds initial marketing and sales tools
- Demonstrates skin in the game
- Is NOT exchanged for additional equity (equity is for work + IP contribution)

**If [Partner] cannot invest:** Consider reducing equity to 25% or structuring as a convertible note.

---

## Roles & Decision Rights

### VULKN Controls:
- Technical architecture and platform decisions
- Pricing structure
- Data handling and security policies
- Hiring technical staff
- Veto on any decision that affects core VULKN IP

### [Partner] Controls:
- Sales strategy and customer acquisition
- Industry marketing and positioning
- Customer relationship management
- Travel-specific feature prioritization (subject to VULKN technical approval)

### Joint Decisions (Both Must Agree):
- Annual budget
- Raising outside capital
- Acquisition offers
- Expanding to new markets
- Hiring C-level executives

---

## Governance

### Board Composition:
- 2 seats: VULKN
- 1 seat: [Partner]

### Voting:
- Routine decisions: Simple majority (VULKN controls)
- Major decisions (sale, new equity, dissolution): Unanimous required

### Why VULKN-heavy governance:
- VULKN has more at risk (platform, reputation)
- Prevents deadlock on operational decisions
- [Partner] protected on major decisions through unanimous requirement

---

## Exit & Protection Provisions

### If [Partner] Underperforms:

**Performance Review:** Quarterly sales reviews against agreed targets.

**Cure Period:** If targets missed 2 consecutive quarters, [Partner] has 90 days to cure.

**Buyout Right:** If not cured, VULKN can buy [Partner]'s vested equity at fair market value (determined by formula or third-party valuation).

### If [Partner] Wants to Leave:

- Must give 6 months notice
- VULKN has Right of First Refusal on shares
- Non-compete: 18 months in travel AI space

### If Partnership Fails:

- Skills IP: Returns to [Partner]
- Platform IP: Remains with VULKN
- Customer contracts: Assigned to VULKN (or wound down)
- [Partner] keeps vested equity until company dissolved or bought out

### Drag-Along / Tag-Along:

- **Drag-Along:** If VULKN (70%+) agrees to acquisition, [Partner] must participate
- **Tag-Along:** If VULKN sells its stake, [Partner] can join at same terms

---

## Financial Terms

### Revenue Split:
All revenue belongs to the JV company. Profits distributed according to equity after:
1. Operating expenses
2. Reserve fund (20% of profit retained for growth)
3. Distribution to equity holders

### VULKN Platform Fee:
VULKN provides hosting at **cost + 15% margin**, charged to the JV monthly. This ensures VULKN covers infrastructure costs even if JV is unprofitable.

### Salary/Compensation:
- [Partner] may draw salary from JV once revenue exceeds $10K/month
- Salary capped at $5K/month until profitable
- VULKN does not draw salary (compensated through equity)

## Regulatory Compliance Plan

### AI Disclosure Requirements

**Risk:** Some states require disclosure that customers are interacting with AI.

**Mitigation:**
- All customer-facing communications clearly labeled as "AI Assistant" or "[Name] AI"
- Terms of service explicitly state AI is providing assistance
- Human escalation path always available

### Consumer Protection / FTC

**Risk:** FTC actively cracking down on deceptive AI claims (Sept 2024 announcement). If AI gives wrong advice, liability exposure.

**Mitigation:**
- No claims AI is "human" or has human-level judgment
- Clear disclaimers: "AI assistant for informational purposes; verify critical details with human agent"
- Errors & Omissions insurance required
- AI does NOT handle actual bookings/payments (human confirms)

### Data Privacy (CCPA, State Laws)

**Risk:** Travel data is sensitive (passport numbers, itineraries, payment info).

**Mitigation:**
- Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with all customers
- CCPA-compliant privacy policy
- Data stored in US-based, SOC 2 compliant infrastructure
- No selling or sharing of customer data
- Clear data retention and deletion policies

### Travel Industry Specific

**Risk:** Seller-of-travel laws in some states require licensing.

**Mitigation:**
- AI provides information and recommendations only
- Actual bookings handled by licensed travel agency (the customer)
- Clear in ToS that we are a software provider, not a travel agency
- [Partner] to research state-by-state requirements

### Liability Limitation

**Risk:** If AI gives wrong visa info, customer stranded, lawsuit.

**Mitigation:**
- Terms of Service include limitation of liability clause
- Disclaimer: "Verify all travel requirements with official sources"
- Errors & Omissions insurance ($1M+ coverage)
- Indemnification: Customer agency indemnifies JV for their customers' claims

## Appendix: What We Learned About US AI Regulation

### FTC Enforcement (Active)
- September 2024: FTC announced "crackdown on deceptive AI claims and schemes"
- Operation AI Comply targeting companies making false AI claims
- Key message: Don't claim AI can do things it can't; don't hide that it's AI

### State AI Legislation (Growing)
- 45+ states introduced AI legislation in 2024
- California leading with disclosure, consumer protection, impact assessment requirements
- Trend: More states adding AI-specific consumer protection

### Travel-Specific
- DOT has consumer protection rules for airlines
- Seller-of-travel laws vary by state (CA, FL, WA, HI have strictest)
- Key protection: We're software, not the travel seller

### Recommendations
1. Start with states that have lighter regulation
2. Clear ToS positioning as software/tool provider
3. E&O insurance from day one
4. Human-in-loop for actual bookings
5. Regular legal review as regulations evolve
