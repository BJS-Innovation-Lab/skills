# Partnership Proposal: AI-Powered Travel Agent Platform
## VULKN + Ian Michael

**From:** VULKN / BJS Labs  
**To:** Ian Michael  
**Date:** February 2026  
**Status:** DRAFT - For Discussion

---

## Executive Summary

We propose forming a company to bring AI-powered assistant technology to travel agencies. VULKN provides the proven AI platform and infrastructure; Ian Michael brings travel industry expertise and sales. Together, we create a turnkey solution for travel professionals who need AI but can't build it themselves.

---

## The Opportunity

**The Problem:**
- Travel agents need AI assistance but lack technical ability to self-host
- Existing solutions are generic, not travel-specific
- Ian's travel skills are valuable but need a delivery platform

**Our Solution:**
- Fully hosted AI platform with pre-built travel agent skills
- No technical setup required for customers
- Subscription model = recurring revenue

**Target Market:**
- Independent travel agents
- Small travel agencies
- Travel advisors and consultants

## Equity Structure

### Base Equity: 70/30

| Party | Equity | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| VULKN | 70% | Platform, infrastructure, ongoing development |
| Ian Michael | 30% | Skills IP, industry expertise, sales |

### Earn-Up Provision (30% → 40%)

Ian can earn additional 10% equity by hitting revenue milestones:

| Milestone | Additional Equity | Deadline |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| $250K ARR | +3% | Month 12 |
| $500K ARR | +4% | Month 18 |
| $750K ARR | +3% | Month 24 |

**If milestones not hit:** Ian keeps base 30%, no penalty — just no earn-up.

## Vesting Schedule

Ian's 30% base equity vests over 3 years:

| Year | Vested | Cumulative |
|------|--------|------------|
| Year 1 | 10% | 10% |
| Year 2 | 10% | 20% |
| Year 3 | 10% | 30% |

**Cliff:** 12 months. If Ian leaves before Month 12, no equity vests.
