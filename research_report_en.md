## 4. Recommendations for Truth Hire MVP

To differentiate ourselves from these giants, our MVP should strike where they are weak:

1.  **The Truth Angle:** Metaview and BrightHire focus on *what was said*. We should focus on **whether what was said is true**. None of them have an explicit "Lie Detection" or integrity vetting engine.
2.  **Ease of Use:** Cluely wins by being an app you just download and use. We should avoid "Book a Demo" processes and let users try the tool immediately.
3.  **Targeting:** Focus on staffing agencies or high-growth startups where "candidate fraud" (especially in remote tech) is a real problem that Metaview doesn't solve.
