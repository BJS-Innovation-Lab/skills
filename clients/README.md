# Client Profiles

This folder contains living documents for each client/business we create marketing content for.

## Structure

Each client gets their own folder:

```
clients/
├── {client-name}/
│   ├── story.md      # Their oral history — who they ARE
│   ├── voice.md      # How they sound — with examples
│   ├── customers.md  # Who they serve — real stories
│   └── learnings.md  # What we've learned from feedback
```

## Creating a New Client

1. Run the intake interview (see `skills/marketing-creativity/SKILL.md`)
2. Create folder: `clients/{client-name}/`
3. Create all 4 documents using templates from `skills/marketing-creativity/templates/`
4. Update documents after every campaign

## Rules

- **Never generate content without a profile** — Generic content wastes everyone's time
- **These are living documents** — Update them as you learn more
- **Capture their words** — Exact quotes matter more than your summary
- **Feedback is gold** — Update learnings.md after every campaign
