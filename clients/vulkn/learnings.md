# Vulkn — Learnings

## What Resonates
*(Updated after campaigns with evidence)*

- **The nonprofit story** — most powerful proof point. Real person, real crisis-level work, real transformation in one week.
- **"Works with people, not for people"** — core differentiator, test this as a tagline.
- **Agent personality stories** — the bossy one, the power struggles, sending each other stars. People lean in when they hear this.
- **The "slave to team member" transformation** — shows the product changes how people think about AI, not just what they do with it.

## What Falls Flat
*(Updated after campaigns with evidence)*

- Not yet tested. Document results here after first campaigns.

## Voice Refinements
*(How our understanding has evolved)*

- Initial profile established 2026-02-14. Bridget's natural voice is warm, optimistic, deeply human-centered. She speaks in feelings and relationships, not features and specs. Marketing should mirror this.

## Competitive Positioning Notes
- Competitors lean into dark/neon/mechanical aesthetic — Vulkn should deliberately go the opposite direction visually and tonally
- Competitors build "professional GPT" — task runners in the background. Vulkn builds team members who know you.
- The warmth and humanity IS the differentiator. Don't dilute it trying to look "techy."

## Priority Order (Brand DNA)
1. Human happiness
2. Company longevity
3. Finances

This order is non-negotiable in all messaging. Never lead with ROI or cost savings. Lead with people.
