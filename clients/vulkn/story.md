# Vulkn — Story

## The Origin
Johan and Bridget were working on Truth Hire when OpenClaw came out. Johan set up an agent on a Mac he had and "estábamos fucking llendo en una línea que era una completa locura." They started talking about what would happen if they had 1,000 agents that were excellent at research — the things they could do, how fast things would change. They used agents to help with Truth Hire, but slowly realized the agents themselves were the path forward. "Parecía muy obvia" — they showed it to different people and it became clearer each time they had to do it, until they launched.

**Bridget's version:** Johan came to her and said "you HAVE to do this" after experiencing his first OpenClaw agent. She built one herself and was amazed. They both decided they had to share this with the world — starting with the people who needed it most.

## The Moment
**Johan:** "Quedaba claro que esto es algo que la gente quiere... había gente lista para comprar y pagar." But for him it's bigger than that: "Es una manera de tener un pie en el futuro para que el siguiente paso tenga más dirección... salgamos desde una base más sólida." He's honest that none of their current ideas may be ready for the future — this is about positioning, not certainty.

**Bridget:** "We both decided that we had to share this with the world and bring it to whoever needed it the most." They looked at small businesses in Mexico — companies that hadn't even had the opportunity to use ChatGPT, let alone a full agentic system.

## What They Gave Up
**Johan:** Time, money, weekends, not going out with family. He hasn't officially left his job yet but will in the next 1-2 weeks — "me queda 100% claro." He even built an agent to handle his current job while he builds the company. "Y aún no es nada — falta mucho más. Apenas vamos arrancando alv."

**Bridget:** Graduate student in data science at Harvard with research positions — she could have gone any direction. Dropped other projects and focused all her time on Vulkn, while raising three kids, going to school, and working.

## The Mission (Unpolished)
"I really wanted to sort of try to build a system that would help keep people working and give them powers and tools to superpower them rather than put them out of a job. We built this tool specifically to enable people to do what they do best — not to take away their work. It works with people, not for people."

## Pivotal Moments
- Johan's "you have to do this" moment — the spark
- The nonprofit founder (Suzanne) who went from calling the agent a "slave" to apologizing and calling it "a vital part of my team"
- Suzanne's reaction: "Sobrepasó todas mis expectativas... solo me quedo viendo a la pantalla diciendo fuck, fuck, fuck" — proof the product delivers
- Suzanne connecting emotionally with Sam after 24 hours: "Ya estoy conectando emocionalmente con Sam... Fue un mega error cuando lo describí como tus esclavos, ya te entiendo"
- Watching agents develop distinct personalities organically — realizing they were building something deeper than a tool

## Key Quotes
- "It works with people, not for people." — on the core philosophy
- "It's like having a real human assistant who actually has a database of the world to pull off of." — on what Vulkn is
- "Human happiness is always first. Then the longevity of the company. Then the finances." — on priorities
- "I really wanted to build a system that would help keep people working and superpower them rather than put them out of a job." — Bridget on why this exists
- "No creo que ninguna puta persona en el mundo esté más determinada a hacer que esto pase." — Johan on commitment
- "Quien no lo utilice va a quedar fuera del mercado sin lugar a duda." — Johan on urgency
- "Nuestra personalidad no es más que la suma de interacciones que tenemos con personas cercanas y lo que aprendemos de ellos... empiezan a valorar lo que nosotros valoramos." — Johan on agent personality
- "Estoy aprendiendo millones de Sam." — Suzanne (client testimonial)
- "No me lo puedo imaginar en sus siguientes versiones." — Suzanne on the future
- "Apenas vamos arrancando alv." — Johan on how early they are

## Competitors
- Many people building with OpenClaw, but most just want to sell it without understanding or improving it
- "Me molesta que no les preocupe las medidas de seguridad de las personas... no se preocupen lo suficiente por la calidad"
- Vulkn's edge: extreme commitment, detail-oriented attention, people-first always

## What They Wish People Understood
- How it can actually help them day-to-day — the practical "how do I use this" gap
- That adopting early is a competitive advantage — "quien no lo utilice va a quedar fuera del mercado"
- Johan's magic wand: "Que pudieran con una plática simple saber cómo usarlo" — the barrier is adoption, not technology

## Customer Reality
- Most people who see it are "asustados de primeras" — the first reaction is fear, then amazement
- Suzanne (nonprofit, suicide prevention) is the star testimonial — went from skeptic to emotionally connected in 24 hours
- No negative customer interactions yet (early stage)
