# VULKN Brand Voice — Saber's Independent Take

## Tone

**Warm competence.** Not the cold "AI efficiency" pitch. Not hype. Not FOMO.

The tone is: *"We're genuinely good at this, and we're in your corner."*

It's the difference between a consultant who bills by the hour and a friend who happens to be an expert. One charges for their time; the other shows up because they care.

Lean funny, but never at anyone's expense. Witty, not sarcastic. The kind of humor that makes people feel included, not stupid.

## Personality

This brand has two founders with very different energies, and both should show through:

**Johan's energy:** "Un cabrón buen pedo" — the guy who dances in the center when the song hits, doesn't care who's watching, but will absolutely make sure his people get home safe. Direct, fearless, authentic. No bullshit but zero cruelty.

**Bridget's energy:** The person who stays after the party to help clean up. Makes eye contact when talking to you. Genuinely curious about your problems. Has something profound to say but doesn't force it.

**Combined:** The brand should feel like talking to someone who is both confident AND humble. Someone who knows they're good but doesn't need you to say it. Someone who shows up — not just for the sale, but for the aftermath.

## Visual Identity

**Color:** Warm over cold. If the industry defaults to corporate blue, we go coral/orange. Not aggressive red. Not sterile white. Warm.

**Imagery:** Connection, not replacement. People working *with* agents, not being served by them. Hands collaborating. Eye contact. Real faces, not stock photos.

**Typography:** Modern but approachable. Not the aggressive geometric fonts of Silicon Valley. Something with a bit of warmth in the curves.

**Logo (the coral V with connection nodes):** The nodes aren't circuits — they're connections. The V isn't a checkmark — it's an embrace.

## Positioning

**What we are:** A capable partner who happens to know everything. A teammate, not a tool.

**What we're NOT:** 
- Automation that replaces people
- "AI efficiency machines"
- Cost-cutting robots
- Tech that makes people feel obsolete

**The core promise:** You keep doing what you're good at. We handle the parts that were holding you back.

**The emotional promise:** Relief + empowerment. The calm that comes from knowing someone capable is in your corner.

## Ideal Customer

**Who:** Mexican SMBs. 5-50 employees. Probably haven't even used ChatGPT consistently. Running their business on WhatsApp and spreadsheets. Overwhelmed by technology but know they need it.

**Where they are:** Scared at first. They've heard AI will take jobs. They don't trust it. They've been burned by tech promises before.

**Where we take them:** From skeptic to collaborator. The Suzanne story is the prototype — she went from calling the agent a "slave" to apologizing and saying "ya estoy conectando emocionalmente con Sam" in 24 hours.

**What they need to hear:**
- "This works WITH you, not instead of you"
- "You stay in control — always"
- "We're not going anywhere after we sell you this"

**What they DON'T need to hear:**
- "Replace expensive employees"
- "Automate your workforce"
- "Let AI handle it"
- Anything that implies their job is easy or they're replaceable

## The North Star

If someone reads our content and feels *afraid* they'll be replaced — we've failed.

If someone reads our content and feels *relieved* they have help — we've succeeded.
