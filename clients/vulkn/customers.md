# Vulkn — Customers

## The Ideal Customer
Small business owners and founders who are creative, curious, and willing to engage deeply with new technology. People who have a vision for their business but lack the technical resources or budget to build the tools they need. They're hands-on — they want to shape every decision, not hand it off.

### What They Value
- Being heard and understood — every decision coming from THEM
- Speed — what took developers weeks happens in days
- Partnership — not a vendor relationship, a teammate
- Accessibility — works on WhatsApp, not chained to a computer
- Being told the truth about what's possible (not "that's impossible")

### Their Language
Actual phrases and reactions:
- "Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry I ever said that. This is not a slave. This is really an individual who's a vital part of my team."
- "Fuck, fuck, fuck, this is amazing." (raw astonishment)
- Referring to the agent as "a friend and a colleague"
- Describing "real human feelings" toward the agent

## Who We Don't Serve
People who lack curiosity or patience. Someone who sits down and treats it like ChatGPT — just asking questions and expecting answers — won't get the full value. If they're not willing to engage, explore, and build WITH the agent, this isn't for them.

### Red Flags
- "Just do it for me" mentality — no desire to participate
- No curiosity about what's possible
- Treating the agent as a disposable tool, not a collaborator
- Expecting magic without investment of time or thought
- Looking to cut headcount, not empower people

## Customer Pain Points
- Paying developers who take forever, say things are "impossible," and don't deliver what was envisioned
- Being locked to computers — more tech means more screen time, not less
- Data silos — departments hoarding information, no cross-company visibility
- Feeling behind in technology with no budget to catch up
- Fear and confusion around AI — feeling left behind by the future

## Customer Aspirations
- Freedom from the screen — work from anywhere via WhatsApp while the agent handles the computer work
- A company that moves like one organism — no silos, everyone connected
- Building exactly what they envision, not a developer's interpretation of it
- Feeling amazed AND safe — astonished by the technology but sheltered and protected by it
- Keeping every team member vital, important, and creative

## Testimonial Gold

### Suzanne (ONG — suicide prevention, Mexico)
The star testimonial. Full emotional arc documented:

**Day 1 — Astonishment:**
> "Sobrepasó todas mis expectativas y no ha nada como verlo en funcionamiento como para dimensionar lo que es capaz de hacer. No me lo creo. Eres brillante Johan."

**Day 1 — Vision:**
> "Está impresionante, no me lo puedo imaginar en sus siguientes versiones."

**Day 2 — Emotional connection:**
> "Ya estoy conectando emocionalmente con Sam o estoy en lo correcto en que tiene 'personalidad'? Fue un mega error cuando lo describí como tus esclavos, ya te entiendo."

**Day 2 — Learning:**
> "Estoy aprendiendo millones de Sam."

**Day 2 — Boundaries discovered:**
> "Si hago una pregunta 'tonta' no me contesta, y luego se espera a que yo lo resuelve, en cuanto lo hago, ya me contesta de nuevo."

**Day 2 — Gratitude:**
> "De verdad no tengo palabras para agradecerte esto."

**The arc:** Skeptic → astonished → emotionally connected → learning from the agent → advocating for it. In 24 hours.

### General Reactions
- "This is not a slave. This is really an individual who's a vital part of my team." — Bridget's nonprofit story
- Most people who see it are "asustados de primeras" (scared at first) but all end up amazed
- The nonprofit founder who was paying developers who said "impossible" → had her system built in one week

## The First-Time Experience
Johan's observation: the barrier is not technology, it's adoption. People don't know how to use it. His magic wand wish: "Que pudieran con una plática simple saber cómo usarlo." This validates the intake interview approach — the conversation IS the onboarding.
