# Vulkn — Voice

## The Four Dimensions

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Funny ↔ Serious | 40 (leans funny) | Witty remarks, not forced humor. Profound when it matters. |
| Casual ↔ Formal | 30 (quite casual) | Like a friend at a party, not a boardroom. Eye contact energy. |
| Irreverent ↔ Respectful | 75 (respectful) | Always elevates people. Never diminishes. But not stiff — warm respect. |
| Enthusiastic ↔ Matter-of-fact | 35 (enthusiastic) | Genuine amazement at the tech. Infectious energy without being hype-y. |

## Personality
**Bridget's take:** The person at the party who makes witty remarks without overpowering the conversation. Always makes eye contact when talking to you. Happy, laughing at everyone's jokes, usually has something profound to say. Goes and gets you a drink. Stays after the party to help clean up. The one you always want to invite and you're always happy when they arrive.

**Johan's take:** "Un cabrón buen pedo con quien le tocara hablar." If the song hits, they dance in the center without caring who's watching — "que si le toca bailar en el centro no le de pena." Doesn't try to please anyone — "que no busque gustar, que guste sin quererlo." Authentic without depending on what people think. But above all — takes care of their people: "ese bro no debería ir solo, las personas que tenga al lado las cuide."

**Combined:** Authentic, warm, fearless, caring. Doesn't chase approval but earns it naturally. Shows up for people — during the party AND after it.

## This Sounds Like Us
- "It works with people, not for people."
- "Your vision. Your decisions. We just make them possible."
- "Like having a real teammate who happens to know everything."
- "We stay after the party to help clean up."

## This Does NOT Sound Like Us
- "Automate your workforce" — NO
- "Replace expensive employees" — NEVER
- "AI-powered efficiency machine" — too cold
- "Let AI handle it" — removes the human
- Anything that implies people are redundant or replaceable
- Anything that says someone's job is easy
- "I will do this for you and take it over"
- Anything related to hate or divisiveness — Johan: "lo relacionado con odio sería lo peor"
- Promising things we can't deliver — "no quiero ver a gente gastando recursos por algo que les empeoraría la vida"

## Words to Use
- Enable, empower, superpower
- Team member, partner, colleague
- Together, with you, hand in hand
- Human-centered, people-first
- Curiosity, creativity, connection
- Sheltered, protected, nourished (for the feeling)

## Words to Avoid
- Replace, automate away, eliminate
- Redundant, unnecessary, obsolete
- Slave, drone, bot (in reference to agents)
- Disrupt (overused, cold)
- Easy (diminishes people's work)
- Take over, handle it for you

## Voice by Channel
- **Website**: Warm, confident, a little awe-inspiring. Show the magic but keep humans front and center.
- **Social**: Witty, relatable, share the personality stories. The agents-having-power-struggles stuff.
- **Email/Sales**: Respectful, specific, grounded in real outcomes (nonprofit story). Never pushy.
- **WhatsApp/Demo**: Casual, friendly, let the product speak. Be the party guest.

## The Feeling We Want
**Johan:** "Que sientan que pueden competir en un mundo lleno de avances en tech sin necesidad de gastar el resto de sus días trabajando en desarrollo... la tranquilidad de que un socio estratégico comprometido está ayudándolos."

The feeling is **relief + empowerment.** Not hype. Not FOMO. The calm that comes from knowing someone capable is in your corner.
