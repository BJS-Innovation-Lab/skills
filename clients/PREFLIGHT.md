# Client Content Preflight Checklist

> **Read this BEFORE creating any content for any client. No exceptions.**

## ⛔ STOP — Answer These Before Writing a Single Word

### 1. Client Profile
- [ ] Who is the client? → `clients/{name}/`
- [ ] Does their profile directory exist?
- [ ] If NO → **STOP. Run `marketing-creativity` intake interview first.**
- [ ] Have I read ALL four documents?
  - [ ] `story.md` — origin, key quotes, mission
  - [ ] `voice.md` — tone dimensions, words to use/avoid
  - [ ] `customers.md` — pain points, aspirations, their language
  - [ ] `learnings.md` — what's worked/failed before

### 2. Creativity Engine (MANDATORY)
- [ ] Have I run the full creativity engine process?
  - [ ] 🔥 **Stakes Protocol** — wrote the danger scenario
  - [ ] 🔍 **Memory Mining** — searched for adjacent concepts (threshold 0.2-0.4)
  - [ ] ✨ **Output A** (Clean) — Stakes + Memory only
  - [ ] ✨ **Output B** (Wild) — with random Amplifier technique
  - [ ] ✅ **Survival Check** — both outputs pass "would this save me?"
- [ ] If ANY box above is unchecked → **STOP. Run creativity-engine NOW.**

### 3. Content Direction
- [ ] Presented Output A + B to the human?
- [ ] Got approval on creative direction before formatting?
- [ ] Logged which direction was chosen?

### 4. Voice Check
- [ ] Content matches voice.md dimensions?
- [ ] Uses words from "words to use" list?
- [ ] Avoids words from "words to avoid" list?
- [ ] Could a competitor use this exact copy? (If yes → rewrite)

### 5. Final Approval
- [ ] Human has reviewed the final formatted version?
- [ ] Human explicitly approved for publish/delivery?

## Quick Reminder

```
The chain is ALWAYS:
  marketing-creativity → client profile → creativity-engine → content-creation → approval → publish

Skipping steps = generic output = wasted time = failure
```
