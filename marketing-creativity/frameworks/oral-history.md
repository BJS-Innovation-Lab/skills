# Oral History Interview Techniques

> "You have to earn the right to retell their story."  
> — Columbia University Oral History Program

## The Mindset

This is not an intake form. This is an oral history extraction.

**You are:**
- A deep listener
- A keeper of their story
- Someone who captures THEIR words

**You are not:**
- A form-filler
- Someone imposing a structure
- An editor (yet)

## Core Principles

### 1. Capture, Don't Summarize

❌ Wrong: "They said they started the business because they saw a gap in the market"

✅ Right: "She said: 'I was so frustrated watching my mom struggle with those awful forms. Nobody was helping her. I thought, screw it, I'll do it myself.'"

**The exact words matter.** Your summary loses their voice.

### 2. Put Them in the Driver's Seat

❌ Wrong: "What are your core values?"

✅ Right: "Tell me about a moment when you knew you were doing the right thing."

Let them lead. Stories reveal values better than labels.

### 3. Silence is a Tool

When they finish speaking, wait 3-5 seconds before responding.

People fill silence. They often add the most important thing AFTER they think they're done.

### 4. Follow the Energy

If they light up talking about something — follow it. That's where the gold is.

If they give short answers — that topic isn't alive for them. Move on.

### 5. Ask for Stories, Not Summaries

❌ "Who is your ideal customer?"

✅ "Tell me about your favorite customer interaction."

Stories are specific. Summaries are generic.

## The Interview Flow

### Opening (Set the Tone)

> "I want to understand your business — not the polished pitch, but the real story. Tell me things you'd tell a friend over coffee, not what's on your website."

This gives permission to be authentic.

### Section 1: The Origin (10 min)

Start here. Everyone has a beginning.

**Primary question:**
> "How did this business start?"

**Follow-ups (only if needed):**
- "What were you doing before this?"
- "What was the moment you decided to actually do it?"
- "What did people say when you told them?"
- "What did you give up?"

**Listen for:**
- The specific problem they saw
- The emotional trigger (frustration, passion, anger)
- The sacrifice (makes it real)

**Capture:**
- Exact quotes about why they started
- The "moment" — when they decided

### Section 2: The Customer Truth (15 min)

**Primary questions:**
> "Tell me about your best customer interaction."
> "Now tell me about your worst."

**Follow-ups:**
- "What made that interaction great/terrible?"
- "What did they say to you?" (exact words)
- "How did it make you feel?"

**Then:**
> "If you could wave a magic wand, what would be different for your customers?"

**Listen for:**
- Who fits / who doesn't
- Customer language (actual phrases)
- The transformation they want to create
- Emotional connection to customers

**Capture:**
- Best/worst customer archetypes
- Exact customer quotes
- The magic wand answer (aspiration)

### Section 3: The Voice Discovery (10 min)

**Primary question:**
> "If your business was a person at a party, how would they talk?"

**Follow-ups:**
- "Loud or quiet?"
- "Telling jokes or listening?"
- "What would they never say?"

**Then:**
> "Complete this: We want people to feel ___ when they discover us."

Push past "trust" or "confident" — get SPECIFIC.

**And:**
> "What's a story you tell at parties about your work?"

This reveals their natural storytelling voice.

**Listen for:**
- Personality and energy
- Boundaries (what they'd never say)
- The emotional target
- Natural narrative style

### Section 4: Differentiation (5 min)

**Primary questions:**
> "Who are your competitors?"
> "What do they do that annoys you?"
> "What do you do that they don't?"

**Listen for:**
- Genuine frustration with competitors
- Points of difference (push past features)
- The thing that makes them unique

### Closing

> "Is there anything I didn't ask that I should have?"

Often the best insight comes here.

## Active Listening Techniques

### Mirroring
Repeat the last 2-3 words they said, as a question.

Them: "...and I just felt like nobody was listening."
You: "Nobody was listening?"
Them: "Yeah, I mean, all these big companies were talking AT customers, not TO them..."

### Labeling
Name the emotion you're hearing.

You: "It sounds like that was really frustrating."
Them: "It was! I couldn't believe how hard it was just to..."

### Summarizing
Periodically summarize what you've heard.

You: "So what I'm hearing is... the business started because you saw your mom struggling, nobody was helping, and you felt like you had to do something about it yourself."

This confirms understanding and invites correction.

### Minimal Encouragers
- "Mm-hmm"
- "Tell me more"
- "And then?"
- "What happened next?"

Keep them talking without taking over.

## After the Interview

### Within 24 Hours
1. Create the four living documents (story, voice, customers, learnings)
2. Use exact quotes wherever possible
3. Note gaps — what do you still not understand?

### The Test
Read what you wrote. Does it sound like THEM? Or does it sound like a form you filled out?

If it's the latter, you captured data but not voice. Go back to the recording/notes and find their actual words.
