# Voice Dimensions Framework

Based on Nielsen Norman Group research, brand voice exists on four spectrums. These are **sliders, not switches** — and they can shift by context.

## The Four Dimensions

### 1. Funny ↔ Serious (0-100)

**0 = Pure Comedy**
- Memes, jokes, puns
- Risk: Can undermine trust in serious moments
- Works for: Lifestyle brands, entertainment, youth-focused

**100 = Dead Serious**  
- No humor whatsoever
- Risk: Can feel cold, corporate, unapproachable
- Works for: Legal, medical, crisis communications

**Most brands live at 60-80 serious** with moments of levity.

### 2. Casual ↔ Formal (0-100)

**0 = Ultra Casual**
- "Hey!" / "Send it over" / Contractions everywhere
- Emojis, slang, first names
- Risk: Can seem unprofessional

**100 = Ultra Formal**
- "Dear Sir/Madam" / "Please submit your request"
- No contractions, full titles
- Risk: Can feel distant, bureaucratic

**Channel shifts:**
- Email to customers: 40 casual
- LinkedIn post: 60 formal
- Instagram story: 20 casual
- Contract: 90 formal

### 3. Irreverent ↔ Respectful (0-100)

**0 = Irreverent**
- Challenges norms, provocative, edgy
- May offend some people (intentionally)
- Works for: Challenger brands, disruptors

**100 = Respectful**
- Honors tradition, careful with sensitivities
- Never provocative
- Works for: Heritage brands, sensitive industries

**Warning:** Irreverence requires confidence. If you can't own it, don't try it.

### 4. Enthusiastic ↔ Matter-of-fact (0-100)

**0 = Maximum Enthusiasm**
- Exclamation points! Amazing! Incredible!
- High energy, excitement
- Risk: Can feel fake, exhausting

**100 = Pure Matter-of-fact**
- Just the facts. No hype.
- Calm, measured, informational
- Risk: Can feel boring, uninspiring

**Research shows:** Users respond better to enthusiasm than emotionless language — but context matters. Error messages should be matter-of-fact. Welcome emails can be enthusiastic.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Same voice everywhere** — Not adjusting for channel/situation
2. **Aspirational mismatch** — Writing how they WANT to sound, not how they DO sound
3. **Inconsistency** — Drifting across the spectrum randomly
4. **All adjectives, no examples** — "We're playful" means nothing without showing it
5. **Ignoring negative space** — Not defining what they WOULDN'T say
