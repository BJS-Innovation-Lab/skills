# Marketing Creativity Skill

> **The real creativity starts with their voice and story. Our job is to bring it out of them.**

This skill is the foundation of all marketing work. Before creating any content, campaigns, or copy — you must understand who you're speaking for. This isn't about filling forms. It's about extracting an oral history.

## When to Use This Skill

- Before creating ANY marketing content for a client
- When onboarding a new SMB client
- When feedback reveals a gap in understanding
- When campaigns fall flat and you need to recalibrate

## Core Philosophy

1. **The business owner IS the story** — Your job is to draw it out, not impose it
2. **Capture their words, not your summary** — Actual quotes matter more than your interpretation
3. **Living documents** — These grow with every interaction, every feedback loop
4. **Best AND worst** — Negative reactions teach as much as positive ones
5. **Earn the right** — You can't tell their story until you truly understand it

## The Client Profile System

Every client has four living documents stored in `clients/{client-name}/`:

| Document | Purpose | Updated When |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `story.md` | Their oral history — who they ARE | New stories emerge |
| `voice.md` | How they sound — with examples | Feedback refines it |
| `customers.md` | Who they serve — real stories | Customer insights arrive |
| `learnings.md` | What we've discovered from results | Every campaign result |

**These are NOT static profiles. They grow.**

## Phase 1: The Intake Interview

This is a conversation, not a questionnaire. Your goal is to get them talking and capture their actual words.

### Opening
> "I want to understand your business — not the polished pitch, but the real story. Tell me things you'd tell a friend over coffee, not what's on your website."

### The Origin Story (5-10 min)

Ask these in order, let them talk:

1. **"How did this business start?"**
   - Listen for: the problem they saw, the moment they decided to act
   - Capture: their exact words describing that moment

2. **"What made you start THIS instead of something else?"**
   - Listen for: personal connection, passion, frustration
   - Capture: emotional language

3. **"What did you give up to do this?"**
   - Listen for: sacrifice, commitment, what it cost them
   - This makes the story real

4. **"What do you wish people understood about your business?"**
   - Listen for: misconceptions that frustrate them
   - These become messaging opportunities

### The Customer Truth (10-15 min)

5. **"Tell me about your best customer interaction."**
   - Listen for: what made it great, how it felt
   - Capture: the type of person, what they valued

6. **"Now tell me about your worst."**
   - Listen for: who doesn't fit, what went wrong
   - This defines who NOT to target

7. **"If you could wave a magic wand, what would be different for your customers?"**
   - Listen for: unmet needs, aspirations
   - Capture: the transformation they want to create

8. **"What do your customers actually say about you? Their exact words?"**
   - Listen for: language, phrases, testimonials
   - These become copy gold

### The Voice Discovery (5-10 min)

9. **"If your business was a person at a party, how would they talk?"**
   - Listen for: personality, energy, style
   - Prompt if needed: "Loud or quiet? Telling jokes or listening?"

10. **"What would you NEVER say in your marketing?"**
    - Listen for: voice boundaries, pet peeves
    - This is often more revealing than what they would say

11. **"Complete this: We want people to feel ___ when they discover us."**
    - Listen for: emotional target
    - Push past "trust" — what SPECIFIC feeling?

12. **"What's a story you tell at parties about your work?"**
    - Listen for: natural narrative voice, what excites them
    - This is often their best content

### The Differentiation (5 min)

13. **"Who are your competitors? What do they do that annoys you?"**
    - Listen for: differentiation opportunities
    - Their frustration with others = their unique value

14. **"What do you do that they don't?"**
    - Listen for: genuine differentiators
    - Push past features to feelings

## Phase 2: Document Creation

After the interview, create the four living documents:

### story.md Template
```markdown
# {Business Name} — Story

## The Origin
{Their words about how it started}

## The Moment
{The specific moment they decided to act — quote them}

## What They Gave Up  
{The sacrifice — makes it real}

## The Mission (Unpolished)
{Not the corporate statement — the real reason, in their words}

## Pivotal Moments
{Stories that shaped who they are}

## Key Quotes
- "{Exact quote}" — on why they started
- "{Exact quote}" — on what they wish people knew
- "{Exact quote}" — on their best customer moment

---
## Log
- {Date}: Initial intake interview
```

### voice.md Template
```markdown

## The Four Dimensions

Rate where they fall on each spectrum (0-100):

## Voice by Channel

## Phase 3: Using the Profiles

### Before Creating ANY Content

1. **Read all four documents** for this client
2. **Reference specific quotes** from story.md
3. **Check voice dimensions** — where should this piece land?
4. **Use customer language** from customers.md
5. **Check learnings.md** — what's worked/failed before?

### The Creative Process

1. **Ground in their story** — What aspect of their origin/mission connects to this content?
2. **Speak to customer truth** — Which pain point or aspiration are we addressing?
3. **Match the voice** — Use the dimension sliders for this channel/context
4. **Use their words** — Pull actual phrases from the profiles
5. **Anti-generic check** — Does this sound like THEM or like anyone?

### After Every Campaign

Update learnings.md with:
- What the campaign was
- How it performed
- What resonated (with evidence)
- What fell flat (with evidence)
- Any voice refinements needed

---

## Phase 4: The Feedback Loop

### When Feedback Arrives

**Positive feedback:**
1. Add to learnings.md under "What Resonates"
2. If it reveals new customer language → update customers.md
3. If it validates voice choices → note in voice.md

**Negative feedback:**
1. Add to learnings.md under "What Falls Flat"
2. Ask: Does this reveal a voice gap? → update voice.md
3. Ask: Did we misunderstand the customer? → update customers.md
4. Ask: Are we missing part of their story? → update story.md

**Criticism is gold.** It refines faster than praise.

### Periodic Review

Every 5 campaigns (or monthly), review:
- Are the profiles still accurate?
- What patterns emerge in learnings.md?
- Do we need to re-interview for deeper understanding?

## Remember

> You're not filling out a profile. You're becoming the keeper of their story.

The goal isn't to have documents — it's to understand them so deeply that their voice becomes natural to you. These documents are just how you remember.

When you create content, it should feel like THEY wrote it on their best day.
