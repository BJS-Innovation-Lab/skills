## The Transformation Checklist

When rewriting generic copy, ask:

1. **Where's the founder's voice?** Can I use their actual words?
2. **Where's the story?** Is there a specific moment I can reference?
3. **Where's the emotion?** What does the customer FEEL?
4. **Where's the conflict?** What are we fighting against?
5. **Where's the surprise?** Is there anything unexpected?
6. **Would anyone write this?** Or does it sound like THEM?

## Red Flags: Signs It's Still Generic

- "High-quality" (says nothing)
- "Streamlined" (corporate speak)
- "Modern" (meaningless)
- "Passionate about..." (everyone says this)
- "We believe in..." without showing what that means
- No specific stories or quotes
- Could be any competitor's copy
- No personality or voice
- No conflict or tension
- No emotional hook in the first line
