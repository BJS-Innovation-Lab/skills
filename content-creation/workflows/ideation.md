# Content Ideation Workflow

Generate topic ideas grounded in client profile and creative engine.

---

## Step 1: Mine the Profile

### From story.md
- Origin story angles
- Pivotal moments to share
- Mission-driven content
- "Why we started" variations

### From customers.md
- Pain point deep-dives
- Aspiration content
- FAQ → content
- Customer story spotlights

### From learnings.md
- Topics that resonated → expand
- Topics that failed → avoid or retry differently
- Emerging patterns

---

## Step 2: Apply Angle Multiplier

For each base topic, generate 5 angles:

| Angle | How It Works |
|-------|--------------|
| **Contrarian** | "Why [common belief] is wrong" |
| **Story** | Personal narrative from client |
| **Data** | Stats-driven insight |
| **How-To** | Practical steps |
| **Trend** | Connect to current events |

**Example:**
Base topic: "Quality ingredients"

1. Contrarian: "Cheap flour is actually more expensive"
2. Story: "What my grandmother taught me about flour"
3. Data: "The 73% markup you're paying for 'artisan'"
4. How-To: "How to spot real sourdough (most aren't)"
5. Trend: "Why everyone's suddenly gluten-intolerant (it's not gluten)"

---

## Step 3: Run Creativity Engine

Pick top 3 topics and run through:
1. Stakes protocol
2. Memory mining
3. Generate A + B angles

---

## Step 4: Score and Prioritize

Rate each idea:

| Criteria | Score 1-5 |
|----------|-----------|
| Relevance to customer pain | |
| Uniqueness (competitors doing this?) | |
| Voice match | |
| Ease to create | |
| Aligns with current goals | |

**Total: /25**

Pick top ideas for content calendar.

## Monthly Ideation Session

Run this monthly for each client:

1. Review learnings.md for patterns
2. Mine profile for fresh angles
3. Generate 15-20 raw ideas
4. Score and prioritize
5. Select 8-12 for content calendar
6. Assign formats (blog, email, social)

## Output Template

```markdown
## Content Ideas — {Client} — {Month}

### Tier 1 (Prioritized)
1. **[Topic]** — {Angle} — {Format}
   Why: {reason tied to profile}

2. **[Topic]** — {Angle} — {Format}
   Why: {reason tied to profile}

### Tier 2 (Backup)
- [Topic] — {Angle}
- [Topic] — {Angle}

### Rejected (and why)
- [Topic] — {reason}
```
