## The 3-Second Rule

You have 3 seconds to stop the scroll. The hook is everything.

## Structure

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

│  Stop thumb. Create pattern interrupt.  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  VALUE (2-4 lines)                      │
│  Why should they care?                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ENGAGEMENT (Final line)                │
│  Comment, share, or click.              │

## Platform Adjustments

### Instagram
- Visual first
- Hook in first line (before "...more")
- Hashtags in comments or at end
- Carousel for depth

### LinkedIn
- Professional but human
- Story format works well
- No hashtag abuse (3-5 max)
- Ask for engagement explicitly

### Twitter/X
- Punchy, quotable
- Thread for depth
- No hashtags in most cases
- Ratio of value to promo: 5:1

### Facebook
- Longer form OK
- Questions drive comments
- Personal > polished

## Example: Clean vs Wild

**Topic:** Why quality ingredients matter

**Clean (A):**
> We don't buy flour. We buy relationships.
> 
> Same mill. Same farmer. Same field for 15 years.
> 
> You can taste the difference.
> 
> What's one thing you won't compromise on?

**Wild (B — Genre Collision: Recipe):**
> Recipe for mediocre bread:
> 
> 1. Buy cheapest flour
> 2. Skip the wait (fermentation is for suckers)
> 3. Add "natural flavors" (translation: chemicals)
> 4. Wonder why it tastes like cardboard
> 
> We do the opposite of this.
> 
> What's a shortcut you refuse to take?
