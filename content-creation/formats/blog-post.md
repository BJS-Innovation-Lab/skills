## The Hook

**Goal:** Stop scrolling in 2 sentences.

**Techniques:**
- Contrarian: "Everything you know about X is wrong."
- Question: "What if [unexpected thing]?"
- Story: "Last Tuesday, a customer called us crying."
- Data: "73% of [audience] make this mistake."
- Confession: "I used to believe X. I was wrong."

**Voice check:** Does this sound like {client} at their boldest?

---

## The Context

**Goal:** Make them feel understood. Set up the problem.

- Reference customer pain point (from customers.md)
- Use their language (actual phrases)
- Build tension: "Here's what most people do... and why it fails."

**Length:** 1-2 paragraphs max.

---

## The Body

**Goal:** Deliver actual value.

**Structure options:**
- How-to: Steps 1, 2, 3...
- Listicle: "5 ways to..."
- Problem/Solution: Alternate pain → relief
- Story: Narrative arc with lessons
- Framework: Introduce a mental model

**Rules:**
- Use subheadings (scannable)
- One idea per section
- Examples > abstractions
- Client voice throughout

---

## The Proof

**Goal:** Make it credible.

**Options:**
- Customer story (from customers.md)
- Data/statistics
- Personal experience (from story.md)
- Expert quote
- Before/after

---

## The CTA

**Goal:** Clear next action.

**Match to content goal:**
| Goal | CTA Type |
|------|----------|
| Awareness | "Share this" / "Follow for more" |
| Trust | "See our work" / "Read more stories" |
| Conversion | "Get started" / "Book a call" |
| Engagement | "What do you think?" / "Reply with your experience" |

**Voice check:** Does this sound pushy or natural for {client}?

## Example: Clean vs Wild

**Topic:** "Why we don't rush orders"

**Clean (A):**
> # Why We Take Our Time (And You'll Thank Us For It)
> 
> You could get bread faster. The grocery store is open 24/7.
> 
> But here's what fast bread costs you: preservatives to extend shelf life, machines instead of hands, recipes optimized for speed instead of taste.
> 
> We bake like my grandmother did — slowly, by hand, with ingredients you can pronounce...

**Wild (B — Genre Collision: Breakup Letter):**
> # Dear Rush Orders, We Need to Talk
> 
> It's not you. It's us. Actually, no — it's you.
> 
> You want everything NOW. You don't care that dough needs to rest. You don't understand that flavor takes time. You think 3 hours is "too long" for bread that took my grandmother 60 years to perfect.
> 
> We can't do this anymore. We're seeing other customers now. The patient ones...
