## Subject Line

**Goal:** Get opened. That's it.

**Techniques:**
- Curiosity gap: "The thing nobody tells you about X"
- Personal: "Quick question, {name}"
- Urgency: "Ends tonight" (only if true)
- Story tease: "What happened when we tried X"
- Contrarian: "Stop doing X (seriously)"

**Rules:**
- 40-60 characters (mobile-friendly)
- No ALL CAPS
- No spam words (free, act now, limited time)
- Match preview text (don't repeat)

---

## Preview Text

**Goal:** Extend the subject line hook.

- 40-90 characters
- Continues the thought
- Creates more curiosity or completes the hook

**Example:**
- Subject: "The mistake we almost made"
- Preview: "It would have cost us everything."

---

## Opening Line

**DON'T:**
- "Hope this email finds you well"
- "I wanted to reach out"
- "Just checking in"
- "As per my last email"

**DO:**
- Jump straight to value
- Reference something specific
- Be human

**Examples:**
- "You asked about X. Here's what I found."
- "Remember that problem you mentioned?"
- "Two things happened this week that you need to know about."
- "I was wrong about something."

---

## Body

**Rules:**
- ONE idea per email
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- White space is your friend
- Write like you talk
- Use their voice dimensions

**Structure options:**
- Problem → Solution → CTA
- Story → Lesson → CTA
- News → Why it matters → CTA
- Question → Answer → CTA

---

## CTA

**Rules:**
- ONE action per email
- Make it crystal clear
- Button or link, not both
- Repeat at end if email is long

**Examples by goal:**
| Goal | CTA |
|------|-----|
| Click | "See how it works →" |
| Reply | "Hit reply and tell me..." |
| Book | "Grab a time here" |
| Buy | "Get yours before Friday" |

---

## Sign-off

**Match their voice:**

| Voice | Sign-off |
|-------|----------|
| Casual | "— Sarah" / "Talk soon" |
| Warm | "Cheering you on, Sarah" |
| Professional | "Best, Sarah" |
| Playful | "Sent from my phone while avoiding [X]" |

---

## Example: Clean vs Wild

**Topic:** Announcing a new product

**Clean (A):**
> **Subject:** We made something new
> **Preview:** And it's not what you'd expect.
> 
> We've been quiet lately.
> 
> That's because we've been in the kitchen, testing something my grandmother never made but would have loved.
> 
> It's ready. And you get first look.
> 
> [See what we made →]
> 
> — Maria

**Wild (B — The Roast):**
> **Subject:** We almost didn't make this
> **Preview:** Our accountant said no.
> 
> Our accountant: "Nobody wants that."
> Our head baker: "It won't sell."
> Me: "Let's make it anyway."
> 
> They were wrong. It's selling out.
> 
> Here's the thing everyone said wouldn't work:
> 
> [See the "failure" →]
> 
> — Maria
> 
> P.S. The accountant still won't try it.
